"Clare Foran,Haley Talbot,Kristin Wilson","CNN — The House is expected to take up a GOP stopgap bill to extend government funding on Friday – but House Speaker Kevin McCarthy appears to lack the votes to pass it and Congress is still on track totrigger a government shutdown . The Senate and Houseare at an impasseover how to keep the government operating, and a shutdown is now imminent with funding set to expire on September 30. McCarthy is gearing up to have his chamber consider a GOP stopgap bill with border provisions attached as House GOP leaders haveinsisted that border security must be addressedas part of the spending fight.But if the bill comes to the House floor, it is likely to provoke a major confrontation between McCarthy and hardline conservatives who have railed against the prospect of a short-term funding extension, arguing that Congress should be focused instead on passing full-year spending bills. As a shutdown looms, McCarthy faces the most significant challenge to his leadership as speaker to date as some House conservatives have threatened the possibility of a voteto oust him from the position. The speaker refused to say on Thursday whether he would try to cut a deal with Democrats if conservative hardliners bring down his stopgap measure. “I still got time, I got time to do other things,” McCarthy responded when asked by CNN’s Manu Raju what will happen if the stopgap bill fails.

As the shutdown deadline rapidly approaches, the federal government has begun preparing for its effects. A shutdown could have enormous impactsacross the country, in consequential areas ranging from air travel to clean drinking water, as many government operations would come to a halt, while services deemed “essential” would continue. Separately, House GOP leaders brought a series of spending bills to the floor Thursday evening as they try to show conservatives they are working in good faith to advance full-year funding bills.The House passed several of those spending bills, but the measures would not stop a shutdown and have no hope of passing in the Senate.At the end of the night, a bill to fund the Department of Agriculturefailed to pass on the floorwith 27 Republicans voting against it, highlighting once again the difficulty Republicans have had coalescing around spending bills. Meanwhile, the Senate is working to advance a bipartisan stopgap bill that would keep the government open through November 17 and provide additional aid to Ukraine and disaster relief. McCarthy has so far dismissed that bill.It could take until Monday to pass the Senate’s bill to keep the government open if GOP Sen. Rand Paul slows down the process – as he has vowed to do – over his demand that the bill drop the $6.2 billion in aid to Ukraine it contains, according to senators. That would put it past the Saturday evening shutdown deadline.",House expected to take up GOP stopgap bill but Congress still on track for a shutdown,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/09/29/politics/kevin-mccarthy-shutdown-latest/index.html

The dan­gerous – and sometimes deadly – consequences ofhazingare prevalent at US universities, placing their sports programs in particular under growing scrutiny.Athletic programs atBoston College, New Mexico State University and Northwestern Universityare just three US institutions that have been dealing with hazing allegationsin2023.Ascalls for a change in culture among the student athlete community grow louder,here’swhat you need to know about hazing and its troubling relationship with colleges in the US.What is hazing?Many college websites carry their own definitions of what constitutes hazing.According to the organization StopHazing , itis an activity that “humiliates, degrades, abuses, or endangers” an individual seeking to join– orparticipatein –a group, “regardless of the person’s willingness to participate.”Normallyassociated with Greek-letter groups – also called fraternities and sororities – hazing takes many forms but can involve consumption of alcohol, sleep deprivation, physical and verbal abuse or degrading sexual acts.Northwestern football staffers wore shirts that read ""Cats Against the World"" with the number 51, former head coach Pat Fitzgerald's number he wore when he played at the school, during practice on Wednesday, August 9. Matt Zahn/TwitterNorthwestern denounces football staffers for ‘tone deaf’ shirts worn at practice amid hazing lawsuits It is usually practiced by older students towards younger college classmates seeking to be inducted or initiated into a team, organization or society, and has historically taken place in educational institutions around the world, like European universities and British public schools.TheNational Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)defines hazing as “any act committed against someone joining or becoming a member or maintaining membership in any organization that is humiliating, intimidating or demeaning, or endangers the health and safety of the person.“Hazing includes active or passive participation in such acts and occurs regardless of the willingness toparticipatein the activities. Hazing creates an environment/climate in which dignity and respect are absent.”How prevalent is it?According toa2018 surveyof seven US universities published by the Journal of Student Affairs Research and Practice, 42.7% of respondents said that they had experienced hazing in varsity athletic teams.That was the highest incidence of hazing among a student group or team, ahead of fraternities and sororities, in which 38.3% of respondents reported having experienced hazing.More than a quarter (26%) of respondents involved in clubs, teams and organizations said that they had experienced hazing, while more than two-thirds (69.8%) of students said that they were aware of hazing on campus.“The most common hazing practices across all types of student groups involved behaviors requiring high-risk drinking, social isolation, personal servitude, and humiliation,” the survey said.Former Northwestern quarterback Lloyd Yates speaks at a news conference in Chicago, Monday, July 24, 2023. A Northwestern hazing scandal includes multiple sports, men and women, attorneys have said. (AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh) Nam Y. Huh/APLloyd Yates: ‘By bringing this to light, we can make real change,’ says former Northwestern player on allegedhazing culture “Students identifying as male reported participating in more behaviors meeting the definition of hazing than their female peers.”What are its origins?Hazing is an age-old practice and can be traced back to Ancient Greece when Platoobservedit among his students in fourth-centuryB.C.Athens, according toHank Nuwer , a journalist and author of several books on hazing.Pennalism– a system of tormenting first-year university students – was exhibitedat educational institutions in Europe throughout the Middle Ages, and forms of hazing later occurred at British public schools, roughlydating back tothe 17th century.By the mid-19th century, hazing was common on college campus fraternities in the US and has been prevalent ever since.Nuwer has calculated that there was at least one US school, club or organization hazing death reported every year from 1959to 2021,with the first being recorded in 1838.The practice takes place in different settings around the world, including high schools, themilitaryand workplaces, according toStopHazing.Why has it become commonplace?NuwertoldCNN in 2018 that hazing is driven by social cohesion and the need to make new friends in an unfamiliar environment.“This collective need to belong is very, very strong,” he said, adding that peer pressure leads those overseeing the hazing to go along with questionable behavior so as not to upset the status quo.Hazing practices can become locked in an ongoing cycle at universities as former victims eventually become perpetrators – a way of continuing what they see as tradition.Recent examplesThere has been considerable fallout following allegations of hazing among college sports teams this year.On September 20,Boston Collegeannounced that it had suspended its men’s and women’s swimming and diving programs indefinitely for hazing, saying that it “does not – and will not – tolerate hazing in any form.”In July,Northwestern Universityfired long-time  football coach Pat Fitzgerald following allegations of hazing within the school’s football program. Fitzgerald stands on the sidelines while the Northwestern Wildcats play the Ohio State Buckeyes in December 2018. Joe Robbins/Getty Images/FileFitzgerald, who spent 17 seasons as head coach of the Wildcats, has said previously that he was not aware of the alleged hazing and that he was “disappointed” to learn of these allegations.At the time, university president Michael Schill said that he had received “hundreds and hundreds of emails” describing how Fitzgerald had transformed the lives of current and former student athletes but added that “we have an obligation – in fact a responsibility – to live by our values.”The head coach, Schill said, isultimately responsiblefor a team’s culture.The following week, attorneysrepresentingat least15 former Northwestern University student athletesannounced plans to sue the university over allegations that its athletics department fostered a “toxic culture” whichfacilitatedharassment and sexual abuse.Civil rights attorney Ben Crump said that the former student athletes had spoken about “a pattern and practice of a culture that was predicated on physical intimidation, harassment, discrimination, abuse – both mentally and sexually – and it was normalized.”Last month, former Northwestern University offensive linemanRamon Diazannounced that he is suing the school and Fitzgerald over allegations of racism and hazing during his time on the team from 2005 to 2008. Former Northwestern University football player Ramon Diaz is suing the school over hazing and racism allegations. Claire Savage/AP/File“The social pressure and hazing on Northwestern’s football team was so severe that even unwilling participants were forced to conform to a culture of abuse, racial discrimination,bigotryand sexual exploitationin order tobe part of the ‘Wildcat family,’” Diaz’s lawsuit states.Northwestern spokesperson Jon Yates has said that the university does not comment on pending litigation, but told CNN, in response to Diaz’s lawsuit, that it is “committed to do whatever is necessary to address hazing-related issues.”In February,New Mexico State Universitysuspended its men’s basketball program over hazing allegations andfired head coach Greg Heiardays later.Penalties for hazingWhile 44 statescarry anti-hazing laws , a hazing convictionoften constitutesa minor misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of $500 and zero jail time.At least 12 of those 44 states have tougher statutes on hazing, making it a felony if it results in death or serious injury.Montana, Wyoming, South Dakota, New Mexico, Alaskaand Hawaii currently have no anti-hazing laws in place.Allegations of hazing can lead to lengthy and expensive litigation processes for universities.In January, the family ofStone Foltz , a Bowling Green student who prosecutors said died from alcohol intoxication during a 2021 fraternity hazing, reached a $2.9 million settlement with the university.The settlement was the largest payout by a public university in a hazing case in the state of Ohio, according to the family’s attorney.

"Amy O'kruk, Tami Luhby","CNN — With Congressbarrelingtoward a government shutdown, many Americans are wondering how it could affect them. Here’s a guide to what you can expect.What is a government shutdown?A government shutdown happens when Congress doesn’t approve funding for the federal government by the time the new fiscal year starts on October 1. Each year, Congress must pass the 12appropriation billsthat make up thediscretionary spending budgetand set funding levels for federal agencies.What happens during a government shutdown?If lawmakers fail to enact all or some of the appropriation bills, many government operations grind to a halt, resulting in a full or partial government shutdown until Congress acts. However, government functions that are deemed essential will continue.Each federal agency comes up with a contingency plan that outlines which of its functions will continue during a shutdown and which will stop, as well as how many of its employees will continue working and how many will be furloughed until the shutdown ends.What it means for youBecause many federal workers are off the job during a government shutdown, many services are stopped or slowed, disturbing the day-to-day life for many Americans.Notably, Social Security payments to seniors, Americans with disabilities and others would continue to be distributed. The Postal Service will also continue regular service.Here are some examples of how a shutdown could affect you. What it means for government workersWhen a shutdown occurs, millions of federal employees and military service members do not get paid until it ends.Employees deemed “essential,” such as those in services that protect public safety or national security, keep working. In the past, this included services such as federal law enforcement, air traffic control and the US postal service.Non-essential employees are furloughed, or temporarily suspended.Both groups must pull from savings or find other ways to stretch their dollars, not only until the shutdown ends but until back pay arrives. The number of workers affected depends on if the shutdown is full or partial. If some appropriation bills pass on time, those corresponding federal agencies will have approved funding and continue operating as normal, resulting in only a partial shutdown.During thelastgovernment shutdown in 2018-19, an estimated 420,000 federal employees worked without pay and another 380,000 were furloughed. But depending on which agencies are affected, these numbers can be much higher.Government contractors are even worse off. Unlike federal workers, contractors have no guarantee of getting back pay once the government reopens. Contractors number in the millions and include firms that work for NASA, the Department of Homeland Security, Federal Aviation Administration, and other federal agencies, providing a range of services such as IT or infrastructure repair.What it means for the economyOn a national scale, government shutdowns can have far-reaching economic consequences, hampering growth and promoting uncertainty, especially if they drag on. Some of these costsincluderaising the unemployment rate, lowering the growth in gross domestic product (GDP), and raising the cost of borrowing. Each week of a government shutdown couldcostthe US economy $6 billion and shave GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2023, according to estimates by EY.A shutdown also renders the state of the US economy unclear. In such an event, the Bureau of Labor Statistics stops releasing data, such as key figures on inflation and unemployment, making itchallengingfor the Federal Reserve and investors to interpret the economy and make decisions – decisions that are especially crucial at the moment as the Fed is at a pivotal point in its campaign to defeat high inflation.Business as usual across the country is affected too. During the last shutdown, the governmentpausedtwo major Small Business Administration loan programs, which distribute nearly $200 million per day to small and midsize US businesses. New business also stalls. In 2019, pending company mergersslowedbecause the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) wasn’t fully staffed and initial public offerings were put on pause after the SECstoppedreviewing and approving filings.

Josh Campbell,"CNN — Officials were called to the southern California home ofBritney Spearson Wednesday to conduct a wellness check after the singerposted a videoon social media depicting her dancing with knives.Someone close to Spears called authorities “genuinely concerned about her wellbeing,” Ventura County Sheriff’s Office Captain Dean Worthy told CNN.“Some would argue this is her expressing her creative freedom, and some might argue this is dangerous and there’s a safety issue or mental health concern,” said Worthy, but authorities opted to check on the singer’s well-being due to the initial call from someone close to Spears.CNN has reached out to a representative for Spears for comment.The initial call from the Spears associate, whom authorities are not naming, was to the Los Angeles Police Department mental health assessment team, which then referred the call to the sheriff’s office, said Worthy. The sheriff’s office dispatched a sergeant who “has had multiple prior contacts with Ms. Spears over the course of many years” and who had rapport with the singer, to the star’s home in Thousand Oaks, California, to check on her wellbeing, said Worthy.The sergeant arrived at the Spears home, Worthy said, and was contacted over an entrance intercom by a member of Spears’ security team. The sergeant “explained he was there based on information [Spears] may be experiencing a potential mental health crisis or in danger of self-harm,” said Worthy. The singer’s head of security told the sergeant he was with Spears, there was no threat to her safety, and the singer did not want deputies to enter the property. Worthy said Spears’ attorney also called the sergeant, “explained he had just spoken with the singer,” and “assured him there were no issues with Ms. Spears mentally, physically, or otherwise.” On Monday, Spears shared video of herself dancing with what appears to be two metal kitchen knives on Instagram. She later updated the post with the caption: “I started playing in the kitchen with knives today,” later adding, “Don’t worry they are NOT real knives !!! Halloween is soon!”After receiving assurances from two independent parties that Spears was not in danger, Worthy said the sergeant departed the residence.In January, Spears was the subject ofanother wellness check , when she said “prank phone calls” prompted police to visit her home.The singer posted a note to Twitter at the time in which she addressed the police visit and said, “I love and adore my fans but this time things went a little too far and my privacy was invaded.”Spears went on to specify that the police “never entered” her home and that once they arrived, “they quickly realized there was no issue and left immediately.”The singer lamented that the incident left her feeling “gaslit and bullied” and that she was “being portrayed once again in a poor an unfair light by the media.”“During this time in my life, I truly hope the public and my fans who I care so much about can respect my privacy moving forward,” she wrote.In an emailed statement to CNN in January, Sgt. Jason Karol from the Ventura County Sheriff’s office confirmed that the department had “received some calls from concerned fans” after Spears deleted her Instagram account.CNN’s Dan Heching contributed to this report.

"Kevin Liptak,MJ Lee,Kayla Tausche,Arlette Saenz"," WashingtonCNN — President Joe Biden issued blunt new warnings about ongoing existential threats to US democracy in a major address Thursday, sharpening the central argument inhis potential rematch with Donald Trumpand asking voters to prioritize the health of American institutions.“There’s somethingdangerous happening in Americanow,” Biden said during his speech in Arizona, where he was also honoring his friend, the late Republican Sen. John McCain. “There’s an extremist movementthat does not share the basicbeliefs of our democracy: The MAGA movement.”“There’s no question that today’sRepublican Party is driven and intimidatedby MAGA Republican extremists,” he said, using the acronym for Trump’s political movement. “Their extreme agenda, if carried out, would fundamentally alter the institutions of American democracy as we know it.”The stark message was Biden’s most forceful attempt at calling out Trump’s antidemocratic behavior since the former president was criminally charged for his attempts to subvert the 2020 election results. It offered a taste of Biden’s forthcoming reelection message, one centered on Trump’s own words and actions as threats to democracy. Biden said his predecessor was guided not by the Constitution or decency, but by “vengeance andvindictiveness.”As indictments and arrests of the former president piled up over the summer,Biden remained mostly silenton his predecessor, wary of appearing to intervene in Justice Department business. His most substantive comment on Trump’s myriad legal issues was a sarcastic remark about his mugshot in the Fulton County, Georgia, case.But as Trump’s prohibitive lead in the Republican primary remains unchanged – and as Biden’s own standing remains mired in low approval – the president is sharpening his attacks on his most likely 2024 rival as a danger to democracy. Thursday’s speech served as yet another sign that the days of trying to keep Trump at an arm’s length are long gone.“Trump says the Constitution gave him the right to do whatever he wants as president,” Biden said, referencing his most likely GOP challenger by name. “I’ve never heard presidents say that in jest.”He alluded to Trump’s recent suggestion that Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, could be executed, and said Republican silence on the comment was “deafening.”Stopping the erosion of democratic institutions and values was central to Biden’s decision to run for president in 2020, it will again be core to his reelection campaign, officials said, as he looks to energize voters and donors who have otherwise appeared lukewarm about a rematch between the two men.“We should all remember: Democracies don’t have to die at theend of a rifle.They can die when people aresilent, when they fail to standup,” Biden said.Senior Biden advisers had mulled over the timing and location of Thursday’s speech for weeks. Previously, Biden has sought to harness the symbolic settings of Independence Hall and Gettysburg to issue warnings aboutthe state of American democracy. Advisers eyed similar sites pegged to American history on the East Coast before settling on Tempe, Arizona, in part as a way to honor the late Republican Sen. John McCain, whom Biden was friends with for decades and referred to as a “brother.” Biden announced funding to construct the McCain Library, honoring his longtime friend.Arizona was also a center of Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, and a state where voters rejected candidates who denied the results two years later. That effort loomed large in the president’s message.“I believe in free and fair elections and peaceful transfer of power. I believe there’s no place in America – none, none, none – for political violence,” Biden said.Biden’s advisers also selected the day after the second Republican primary debate, hoping to insert Biden into a news cycle otherwise dominated by the GOP contest. Trump skipped the debate, delivering a speech in Michigan instead as helooks to cut into Biden’s supportamong union workers.The speech came at a moment of political uncertainty for Biden, as he faces persistent questions about his age, disapproval of his handling of the job and an indictment of his son, Hunter. House Republicans held their first hearing in an impeachment inquiry into Biden on Thursday.Many senior Democrats believe once voters come to see the 2024 election as a contest between Biden and Trump, the stakes will be clearer and the current president’s standing will improve.At one point in his speech, Biden was interrupted by climate activists as he urged the audience to “put partisanship aside, put country first.” Kai Newkirk, one of the protesters, had stood up and called on Biden to take further action to address fossil fuels.“I tell you what, if you shush up, I’ll meet with you immediately after this,” Biden said, before resuming remarks.“Democracy is never easy – as we just demonstrated,” he joked.Newkirk added in a statement later Thursday that he did not hear the president’s offer to meet with him but that he would have “gladly” accepted.“I worked hard to elect President Biden, and conscience compelled me to interrupt his speech today to ask why he has yet to declare a climate emergency,” he said in a post on X.Top Biden donors, many of whom have agitated for more forceful attacks on Trump at this early stage in the campaign, were informed of the plans for Thursday’s speech by senior Biden advisers during a fundraising retreat in Chicago earlier this month. Biden began previewing his address to donors behind closed doors last week.In those remarks, Biden debuted new warnings about his predecessor’s potential return to the White House, testing the material off-camera as he and his team were preparing for Thursday’s address.“Let there be no question: Donald Trump and his MAGA Republicans are determined to destroy American democracy. And I will always defend, protect, and fight for our democracy. That’s why I running,” he said at a Broadway theater last week.Two days later, he amplified his warnings to a group of lawyers – and said he was confident he could defeat Trump for a second time.“I’m now running again. Because guess what? I think that it’s likely to be the same fellow, and it’s likely that I think I can beat him again,” he said.Defending democracy is an issue Biden allies believe remains deeply resonant with voters, almost three years after the 2020 contest. The video announcing his reelection opened with footage of the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.In the lead-up to the 2022 midterm elections, Biden delivered a resounding message in front of Philadelphia’s Independence Hall, warning of “MAGA forces” that “tried everything last time to nullify the votes of 81 million people.” Ahead of the speech, Biden convened his communications staff with a group of academics and historians – including Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jon Meacham, who has helped draft his highest-profile addresses – to reflect on the fragile state of the union and compile ideas.The White House remains in touch with several of those historians to continue generating ideas, according to officials.Democrats say the message worked. The administration and national Democrats have touted the results of the 2022 midterm elections, and the fact that a so-called red wave never materialized as many had predicted, as proof the president’s focus on themes like defending democracy struck a chord.Thursday’s remarks were billed by the White House as the president’s fourth major speech on the theme of democracy – Biden spoke to the issue last year to mark the one-year anniversary of the January 6 insurrection, as well as days before the midterm elections.By also honoring McCain during his speech Thursday, Biden hoped to harken to an era of bipartisanship in Washington that has disappeared in recent years. The comparison is amplified given the current battle over government funding, which appears destined to result in a government shutdown by the end of the week.He was joined at the speech by McCain’s widow Cindy, other members of the McCain family and Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs. However, one of the state’s senators, Kyrsten Sinema –who was a Democrat until she left the party last yearto become an independent – said Biden should use his visit to Arizona to observe the situation at the southern border. “It’s well past time for President Biden to see the border crisis first hand and for the administration to do its job, secure the border, and keep Arizona safe. While he’s in Arizona, I’m calling on him to visit the border to actually understand how our communities shoulder the burden of his administration’s failure to address this crisis,” she said in a statement. McCain’s death was deeply personal and painful for Biden for a number of reasons, including the fact that McCain had been diagnosed with the same cancer that took the life of Biden’s son, Beau. After laying a wreath near the site where McCain’s plane was shot down in Hanoi this month, Biden said he missed his former Senate colleague.“He was a good friend,” Biden said.In his eulogy for McCain in the summer of 2018, Biden described his friend as having “lived by a different code – an ancient, antiquated code where honor, courage, integrity, duty were alive.” This story has been updated with additional information. CNN’s Jeremy Diamond contributed to this report.

"Jeremy Herb,Annie Grayer,Marshall Cohen","CNN — House Republicans kicked offtheir first impeachment inquiry hearingThursday laying out the allegations they will pursue against President Joe Biden, though their expert witnesses acknowledged Republicans don’t yet have the evidence to prove the accusation they’re leveling.Thursday’s hearing in the House Oversight Committee didn’t include witnesses who could speak directly to Hunter Biden’s foreign business dealing at the center of the inquiry, but the hearing offered Republicans the chance to show some of the evidence they’ve uncovered to date. None of that evidencehas shown Joe Biden received any financial benefit from his son’s business dealings, but Republicans said at Thursday’s hearing what they’ve found so far has given them the justification to launch their impeachment inquiry.Democrats responded by accusing Republicans of doing Donald Trump’s bidding and raising his and his family’s various foreign dealings themselves, as well as Trump’s attempts to get Ukraine to investigate in 2019 the same allegations now being raised in the impeachment inquiry.Here’s takeaways from Thursday’s first impeachment inquiry hearing: Rep.Jamie Raskin and Oversight Chairman James Comer speak on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, on Thursday. Jonathan Ernst/ReutersGOP witnesses say not enough evidence yet to impeach BidenWhile Republicans leveled accusations of corruption against Joe Biden over his son’s business dealings, the GOP expert witnesses who testified Thursday were not ready to go that far.Forensic accountant Bruce Dubinsky, one of the GOP witnesses, undercut Republicans’ main narrative by saying there wasn’t enough evidence yet for him to conclude that there was “corruption” by the Bidens.“I am not here today to even suggest that there was corruption, fraud or wrongdoing,” Dubinsky said. “More information needs to be gathered before I can make such an assessment.”He said there was a “smokescreen” surrounding Hunter Biden’s finances, including complex overseas shell companies, which he said raise questions for a fraud expert about possible “illicit” activities.Conservative law professor Jonathan Turley also said that the House does not yet have evidence to support articles of impeachment against Joe Biden, but argued that House Republicans were justified in opening an impeachment inquiry.“I want to emphasize what it is that we’re here today for. This is a question of an impeachment inquiry. It is not a vote on articles of impeachment,” Turley said. “In fact, I do not believe that the current evidence would support articles of impeachment. That is something that an inquiry has to establish. But I also do believe that the House has passed the threshold for an impeachment inquiry into the conduct of President Biden.”Turley said that Biden’s false statements about his knowledge of Hunter Biden’s business endeavors, as well as the unproven allegations that Biden may have benefited from his son’s business deals, were reason for the House to move forward with the impeachment inquiry. ( CNN has previously reported that Joe Biden’s unequivocal denialsof any business-related contact with his son have been undercut over time, including by evidence uncovered by House Republicans.) Turley, a George Washington University Law School professor, has repeatedly backed up Republican arguments on key legal matters in recent years, including his opposition to Trump’s first and second impeachments. Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, pushed Turley further on his comments, asking whether he would vote “no” today on impeachment.“On this evidence, certainly,” Turley said. “At the moment, these are allegations. There is some credible evidence there that is the basis of the allegations.” Witnesses are sworn in before the House Oversight Committee on September 28, 2023, on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC. Jacquelyn Martin/APGOP maps out questions they want to answerHouse Republicans opened their first impeachment hearing Thursday with a series of lofty claims against the president, as they try to connect him to his son’s “corrupt” business dealings overseas. House Oversight Chairman Rep. James Comer claimed the GOP probes have “uncovered a mountain of evidence revealing how Joe Biden abused his public office for his family’s financial gain,” even though he hasn’t put forward any concrete evidence backing up that massive allegation. Two other Republican committee chairs further pressed their case, including by citing some of thenewly released Internal Revenue Service documents,which two IRS whistleblowers claim show how the Justice Department intervened in the Hunter Biden criminal probe to protect the Biden family. However, many of their examples of alleged wrongdoing occurred during the Trump administration before Joe Biden took office.Ahead of the hearing, the Republican chairs released a formal framework laying out the scope of their probe, saying it “will span the time of Joe Biden’s Vice Presidency to the present, including his time out of office.”The document outlines specific lines of inquiry, including whether Biden engaged in “corruption, bribery, and influence peddling” – none of which Republicans have proved yet. The memo included four questions the Republicans are seeking to answer related to whether Biden took any action related to payments his family received or if the president obstructed the investigations into Hunter Biden. House Oversight Committee ranking Democratic member Rep. Jamie Raskin speaks on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, on September 28, 2023.Jim Bourg/ReutersNew subpoenas issued for bank recordsHouse Republicans issued three subpoenas Thursday evening for the personal and business records of the president’s son Hunter Biden and brother James Biden – a move Comer had forecast at the close of the hearing.Comer and House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan sent the subpoenas to banks for Hunter and James Biden’s records, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.The subpoenas, which redact the recipients, demand the banks turn over the president’s son and brother’s personal and business records from January 1, 2014, to present by October 12.“The subpoenaed bank records will help the Committees determine whether Joe Biden abused his office by selling access and/or by receiving payments or other benefits in exchange for official acts, which is a critical aspect of the Committees’ impeachment inquiry,” Comer and Jordan wrote.The move does not come as a surprise, as Comer has been signaling his intention to issue the subpoenas for the personal bank records. They show where Republicans will head next in their investigation as they continue to seek evidence to substantiate their unproven allegations about the president.Witness testimony frustrates some RepublicansSome inside the GOP expressed frustration to CNN in real time with how the House GOP’s first impeachment inquiry hearing was playing out, as the Republican witnesses directly undercut the GOP’s own narrative and admitted there is no evidence that Biden has committed impeachable offenses.“You want witnesses that make your case. Picking witnesses that refute House Republicans arguments for impeachment is mind blowing,” one senior GOP aide told CNN. “This is an unmitigated disaster.”One GOP lawmaker also expressed some disappointment with their performance thus far, telling CNN: “I wish we had more outbursts.”The bar for Thursday’s hearing was set low: Republicans admitted they would not reveal any new evidence, but were hoping to at least make the public case for why their impeachment inquiry is warranted, especially as some of their own members remain skeptical of the push.But some Republicans are not even paying attention, as Congressis on the brink of a shutdown– a point Democrats hammered during the hearing.“I haven’t watched or listened to a moment of it,” said another GOP lawmaker. There’s a shutdown looming.” Rep Jim Jordan delivers remarks during the House Oversight Committee hearing on Capitol Hill on September 28, 2023 in Washington, DC.Drew Angerer/Getty ImagesDemocrats attack inquiry for lacking evidence on the presidentDemocrats repeatedly pointed out that the Republican allegations about foreign payments were tied to money that went mostly Hunter Biden – but not the to the president.“The majority sits completely empty handed with no evidence of any presidential wrongdoing, no smoking gun, no gun, no smoke,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the Oversight committee.Raskin’s staff brought in the 12,000 pages of bank records the committee has received so far, as Raskin said, “not a single page shows a dime going to President Joe Biden.”Raskin also had a laptop open displaying a countdown clock for when the government shuts down in a little more than two days – another point Democrats used to bash Republicans for focusing on impeachment and failing to pass bills to fund the government. The Democrats passed the laptop around to each lawmaker as they had their five minutes to question the witnesses.Their arguments also previewed how Democrats intend to play defense for the White House as Republicans move forward on their impeachment inquiry.The Democrats needled Republicans for not holding a vote on an impeachment inquiry – one Democrat asked Turley whether he would recommend a vote, which Turley said he would.

Jamie Raskin speaks on the Democratic side of the aisle, as the House Oversight Committee begins an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden, Thursday, Sept. 28, 2023, on Capitol Hill in Washington. Jacquelyn Martin/APDemocrats push for Rudy to testifyHouse Democrats’ 2019 impeachment of Trump was sparked by Trump’s attempts to push Ukraine to investigate allegations involving Biden and his son’s position on the board of a Ukrainian energy company – some of the same allegations now being probed by the House GOP.That led Democrats Thursday to push for testimony from Rudy Giuliani, who as Trump’s personal lawyer sought to dig up dirt on Biden in Ukraine in 2019.Twice, the Democrats forced the Oversight Committee to vote on Democratic motions to subpoena Giuliani, votes that served as stunts to try to hammer home their argument that Giuliani tried and failed to corroborate the same allegations at the heart of the Biden impeachment inquiry.“I ask the question: Where in the world is Rudy Giuliani?” said Rep. Kweisi Mfume of Maryland, one of the Democrats who forced the procedural vote. “That’s how we got here, ladies and gentlemen. And this committee is afraid to bring him before us and put him on the record. Shame! And the question was raised. What does this have to do with it? It has everything to do with it.”In addition to Giuliani, Raskin sought testimony from Lev Parnas, an associate of Giuliani’s who was indicted in 2019. Parnas subsequently cooperated with the Democratic impeachment inquiry, including providing a statement from a top official at Burisma Holdings, the Ukrainian energy company, stating, “No one from Burisma had any contacts with VP Biden or people working for him.” Several Democrats also raised Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law who worked in the White House, receiving $2 billion from Saudi Arabia through a company he formed after leaving the White House.The Democrats charged that Kushner’s actions were far worse than Hunter Biden’s, because Kushner worked in government, while Biden’s son did not.

James Frater," LondonCNN — A famous tree that has stood sentinel on Britain’s Roman-built Hadrian’s Wall for more than 200 years has been “deliberately felled” in what authorities have called an “act of vandalism.”The sycamore tree, located in the Northumberland National Park in northern England, was made famous to millions around the world when it appeared in Kevin Costner’s 1991 blockbuster film “Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves.”Police said they have arrested a 16-year-old boy following the incident, which was believed to have taken place overnight Thursday.The tree - at a spot known as “Sycamore Gap” – was located on the historic UNESCO World Heritage listed Hadrian’s Wall, which was constructed around 1,900 years ago to guard the furthest northwestern frontier of the Roman Empire. The tree before it was felled. Andre Poling/ullstein bild/Getty ImagesSycamore Gap was considered one of the most photographed trees in England and was voted as English Tree of the Year in 2016.The National Trust heritage charity – which co-manages the site – said it was “shocked and saddened” by the tree’s felling.Andrew Poad, north east general manager at the National Trust, said: “The tree has been an important and iconic feature in the landscape for nearly 200 years and means a lot to the local community and to anyone who has visited the site.”Northumberland National Park Authority said it was now “working with the relevant agencies and partners with an interest in this iconic North East landmark.”The National Park urged visitors to stay away while the site was being made safe.Police, who earlier said they were investigating what was believed to be a “deliberate act of vandalism,” said a 16-year old youth had been arrested in connection with the incident. The sycamore tree, seen here in 2021, was a striking presence on the wild landscape around Hadrian's Wall. Kevin Taverner/CNNHe remains in police custody at this time and is assisting officers with their enquiries,” Northumbria Police posted on X, adding that the “investigation is still at very early stage.”Prior to the arrest, the police force described the tree as a “world-renowned landmark.”“The vandalism has caused understandable shock and anger throughout the local community and beyond,” a statement from Northumbria Police said.Police Superintendent Kevin Waring added: “This is an incredibly sad day. The tree was iconic to the North East and enjoyed by so many who live in or who have visited this region.”“Anyone found to have been responsible for this damage – which we believe to be a deliberate act of vandalism – can expect to be dealt with swiftly and appropriately.” ",Sycamore Gap: 16-year-old boy arrested after famous tree deliberately felled,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/sycamore-gap-tree-deliberately-felled-britain/index.html
"Ivan Watson,Rebecca Wright,Helen Regan,Kathleen Magramo,Yasmin Coles"," Manila, PhilippinesCNN —Chinais behaving like a schoolyard bully toward smaller countries, the Philippine defense secretary told CNN Friday during an exclusive interview in which he warned his nation, and the wider world, had to stand up to Beijing’s territorial expansion in theSouth China Sea .“I cannot think of any clearer case of bullying than this,” said Philippine Secretary of National Defense Gilberto Teodoro Jr. “It’s not the question of stealing your lunch money, but it’s really a question of stealing your lunch bag, your chair and even enrollment in school.”His comments follow increasingly assertive moves by thePhilippines to protect its claimto shoals in the South China Sea during more than a month ofhigh-stakes maritime drama .While tensions between China and the Philippines over the highly-contested and strategic waterway have festered for years, confrontations havespiked this summer , renewing regional fears that a mistake or miscalculation at sea could trigger a wider conflict, including with theUnited States . The region is widely seen as a potential flashpoint for global conflagration and the recent confrontations have raised concerns among Western observers of potentially developing into an international incident if China, a global power, decides to act more forcefully against the Philippines, a US treaty ally. Recentincidentshave involved stand offs between China’s coast guard, what Manila says are shadowyChinese “maritime militia” boatsand tiny wooden Philippine fishing vessels, Chinese water cannonsblocking the resupplyof a shipwrecked Philippine military outpost, and a lone Filipino diver cutting through afloating Chinese barrier .Teodoro characterized the Philippines’ refusal to back down in the waters within its 200 nautical-mile exclusive economic zone as a fight for the very existence of the Philippines.“We’re fighting for our fisherfolk, we’re fighting for our resources. We’re fighting for our integrity as an archipelagic state… Our existence as the Republic of the Philippines is vital to this fight,” Teodoro said in a sit down interview at the Department of National Defense in Manila. “It’s not for us, it’s for the future generations too.”Video Ad Feedback Video purportedly shows Chinese ship firing water cannon at Filipino vessel in disputed waters 00:40 - Source: CNN“And if we don’t stop, China is going to creep and creep into what is within our sovereign jurisdiction, our sovereign rights and within our territory,” he said, adding that Beijing wont stop until it controls “the wholeSouth China Sea .”Beijing says it is safeguarding its sovereignty and maritime interests in the South China Sea and warned the Philippines this week “not to make provocations or seek troubles.” It accused Philippine fishing and coast guard vessels of illegal entry into the area.China claims “indisputable sovereignty” over almost all 1.3 million square miles of the South China Sea, and most of the islands and sandbars within it, including many features that are hundreds of miles from mainland China. Along with the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Brunei and Taiwan also hold competing claims. Over the past two decades China has occupied a number of reefs and atolls across the South China Sea,building up military installations , including runways and ports, which the Philippines says challenges its sovereignty and fishing rights as well as endangering marine biodiversity in the resource-rich waterway.In 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines in a landmark maritime dispute, which concluded that China has no legal basis to claim historic rights to the bulk of the South China Sea.But Beijing has ignored the decision and continues to expand its presence in the waterway.Video Ad Feedback Video released of diver cutting China's floating sea barrier 01:39 - Source: CNNWhat’s at stakeIn his first sit-down TV interview with an international news outlet since he took the position in June, Teodoro was keen to stress whatever happens in the South China Sea impacts the globe.Crucially, the waterway is vital to international trade with trillions of dollars in global shipping passing through it each year. It’s also home to vast fertile fishing grounds upon which many lives and livelihoods depend, and beneath the waves lie huge reserves of natural gas and oil that competing claimants are vying for. With nations already suffering from inflation brought about by Russia’s war in Ukraine, there are concerns that any slow-down in travel and transporting of goods in the South China Sea would result in significant impact to the global economy.

Here's why it matters for the world “It will choke one of the most vital supply chain waterways in the whole world, it will choke international trade, and it will subject the world economy, particularly in supply chains to their whim,” Teodoro said, adding that if this were to happen, “the whole world will react.”The defense secretary warned that smaller nations, including regional partners, rely on international law for their survival.“Though they need China, they need Russia, they see that they too may become a victim of bullying. If they (China) close off the South China Sea, perhaps the next target may be the Straits of Malacca and then the Indian Ocean,” Teodoro said.Risk of conflictVideo Ad Feedback Why it matters who owns the seas (April 2021) 03:48 - Source: CNNOnly a few years ago the Philippines was treading a much more cautious path with its huge neighbor China. But since taking office last year, Philippine President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr has taken a stronger stance over the South China Sea than his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte. On Friday, he defended the Philippine Coast Guard’s removal earlier this week of a floating barrier installed by China in the southeast portion of Bajo de Masinloc, also known as the Scarborough Shoal. A disputed area, the shoal a small but strategic reef and fertile fishing ground 130 miles (200 kilometers) west of the Philippine island of Luzon.Marcos said his administration will not allow foreign entities to put up a barrier “that is within the Philippines,” according to the official Philippine News Agency (PNA). “We are not looking for trouble. What we will do is continue defending the Philippines, the maritime territory of the Philippines, the rights of our fishermen who have been fishing there for hundreds of years,” Marcos said in an interview, while visiting the island of Siargao. “We avoid trouble, we avoid heated exchange but our defense of Philippine territory is strong,” Marcos added, according to PNA. Marcos has also strengthened US relations that had frayed under Duterte, with the two allies touting increased cooperation and joint patrols in the South China Sea in the future.In April, the Philippines identified the locations offour new military basesthe US will gain access to, as part of an expanded defense agreement analysts say is aimed at combating China.Washington has condemned Beijing’s recent actions in the contested sea andthreatened to interveneunder its mutual defense treaty obligations if Philippine vessels came under armed attack there.US Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Lindsey Ford reiterated Washington’s commitment to the mutual defense treaty in testimony before a US House subcommittee on Tuesday.She said the treaty covers not only the Philippine armed forces, but also its coast guard and civilian vessels and aircraft.“We have said repeatedly and continue to say that we stand by those commitments absolutely,” Ford said.

Aaron Favila/APDefense secretary Teodoro has concerns about a possible escalation “because of the dangerous and reckless maneuvering of Chinese vessels” but he was clear that any incident – accidental or otherwise – the blame would lie with China “squarely on their shoulders.”And he called global powers to help pressure Beijing over its moves in the South China Sea. “Peace and stability in that one place in the world will generate some relief and comfort to everyone,” he said. As part of the Marcos administration’s commitment to boost the Philippines defense and monitoring capabilities in the South China Sea, Teodoro said further “air and naval assets” have been ordered.“There will be more patrol craft coming in, more rotary aircraft and we are studying the possibility to acquiring multi-role fighters,” he said, adding that would “make a difference in our air defense capabilities.”This photo taken on April 23, 2023 shows the grounded Philippine navy ship BRP Sierra Madre where marines are stationed to assert Manila's territorial claims at Second Thomas Shoal in the Spratly Islands in the disputed South China Sea. - AFP was one of several media outlets invited to join two Philippine Coast Guard boats on a 1,670-kilometre (1,040-mile) patrol of the South China Sea, visiting a dozen islands and reefs.

Preferring cooler heads to prevail, Teodoro said that diplomacy would provide a way forward providing Chinese leader Xi Jinping complies with international law.“Filipinos I believe are always willing to talk, just as long that talk does not mean whispers in a back room, or shouting at each other, meaning to say there must be substantial talks, open, transparent and on a rules-based basis,” he said, while also adding that talks cannot be used as a delaying tactic by Beijing. The Philippines, he said, has “no choice” but to stand up to China because otherwise “we lose our identity and integrity as a nation.” But conflict, he added, was not the answer or desired outcome.“Standing up doesn’t mean really going to war with China, heavens no. We don’t want that. But we have to stand our ground when our ground is intruded into.”CNN’s Alex Stambaugh contributed reporting.

Historic war office used by Winston Churchill is transformed into luxury Raffles London hotel While it may be one of many hotels opening in London this year, the launch of a purpose-built five-star hotel in the city is almost unheard of these days, with many other brands opting to convert existing buildings instead.“Competition is good, it keeps you on your toes,” Sonja Vodusek, managing director ofthe Peninsula London tells CNN Travel via email.“We’re proud to be coming to London, to work alongside our illustrious neighbors. It’s a very exciting time for the capital.”Picturesque location The newly built hotel is located close to Hyde Park Corner, Wellington Arch and a short distance from Buckingham Palace.

Villa Palladio: India meets Italy at this boutique hotel PenChat, a 24-hour private e-concierge service, is also available to guests. The bespoke staff uniforms are the work of British designer Jenny Packham.The hotel has been designed to “service both visitors and local residents,” with a coffee shop, apparently one of the requirements negotiated during the sale, and a retail arcade, located on the premises.“We believe that the investment we have made into this project, the dedication of our people and the project teams we have worked with, and the quality and the attention to detail that we have strived for, will make this a unique hotel that we believe will stand out not only in London but globally, and will be one of the most important hotels in our group for generations to come,”Clement Kwok, managing director and CEO of The Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels, Limited, owner and operator of The Peninsula, said in a statement.Dining destination The hotel's ground floor restaurant Canton Blue restaurant celebrates the ""spice-trade union of Asian and British cultures.""

Pava LaPerewas killed Friday, but authorities didn’t discover her body for at least three days, according to a statement of charges filed in the District Court of Maryland for Baltimore City obtained by CNN affiliate WJZ. Her body was found near a brick and a pair of red shoes believed to be LaPere’s, the documents say. The medical examiner’s office determined LaPere suffered trauma to the head, face and body, the documents say.But even before the CEO was killed, the man suspected of killing her was being tracked by investigators because police believed he was responsible for a rape, arson and attempted murder days earlier, officials said. The stunning revelations came hours after the suspect, Jason Dean Billingsley, was arrested Wednesday night – ending afrantic manhuntfor the convicted sex offender who had a 30-year sentence but was released from prison last year. CNN has not been able to determine if Billingsley has an attorney at this time.4 alleged felonies in 3 daysBaltimore police believe Billingsley is responsible for an arson, rape and attempted murder that happened September 19 in the 800 block of Edmondson Avenue – about a mile from where LaPere’s body was found days later. Billingsley is accused of raping and attacking a woman before setting her and her boyfriend on fire, according to a statement of charges document filed in the District Court of Maryland for Baltimore City and obtained by CNN affiliate WJZ. “All indications are that this was not a random act of violence,” Baltimore Acting Police Commissioner Richard Worley said. “We have information to believe that the victims … were targeted by the suspect – that the suspect knew the victims and he went into that location for a criminal reason.” Investigators started looking for Billingsley, police said. Police believe three days after the September 19 crimes, LaPere was killed. Pava LaPere earned a spot on Forbes magazine's ""30 Under 30"" list this year, for social impact. from EcoMapTech/X“It seems like she was probably murdered on Friday night, and she wasn’t recovered until they reported her missing … on Monday,” Worley said.Authorities found her body Monday at an apartment building in the 300 block of West Franklin Street. Police said they don’t know of any connection between Billingsley and LaPere, the beloved CEO of EcoMap Technologies.Billingsley was seen on video following LaPere on the street as she approached the building where she lived and worked, law enforcement sources briefed on the investigation told CNN. The video shows the suspect following LaPere from a distance, but LaPere does not appear to be aware of his presence, according to the sources. After LaPere entered the lobby where her company offices are located, she appeared to see Billingsley at the front door looking as though he had difficulty getting into the building – as if he had forgotten his keys, the sources said. LaPere then opened the door for him, and security cameras in the lobby recorded them in conversation, according to the sources. As LaPere walked toward the elevator, those security cameras show Billingsley following her. The statement of charges said LaPere and Billingsley were seen on surveillance video getting into the elevator together.LaPere was killed on the roof, the sources said, and Billingsley is recorded leaving the building about 40 minutes after following her into the elevator.Billingsley is also seen on video leaving the stairwell of the building and entering the lobby, “scrambling for an exit,” according to the statement of charges. He was seen wiping his hand on his shorts before exiting the building, the court documents say.‘I don’t think we made a mistake in this case’Worley defended the police department’s decision to not publicize its search for Billingsley immediately after the September 19 crimes – which critics say might have helped get him back behind bars before LaPere was killed.“The first incident on Edmondson Avenue was not a random act. Had it been a random act, we would have put out a flier right away, saying this individual was on the loose, committing random acts,” Worley said.Jason Dean Billingsley, suspect in murder of Pava LaPere. Baltimore PDManhunt underway for 'extremely dangerous' convicted felon suspected of killing a 26-year-old female tech CEO in Baltimore “We know pretty much why he went into the house on Edmondson Avenue, why he committed those acts. He worked at that building, he was familiar with the victims. I’m not going to say too much more because I don’t want to talk bad about victims. But he was there for a reason,” Worley said.The acting police chief said investigators had been tracking Billingsley and didn’t want to issue a flier too soon, which could prompt the suspect to flee. As for how Billingsley evaded arrest despite police surveillance, Worley said: “We never got close enough.”At one point, police “were within about 88 meters of capturing the suspect, but he was able to elude our capture,” Worley said. “I don’t think we made a mistake in this case. I think our detectives made the same decision we make every single time based on the facts and circumstances that we have,” he said. But LaPere’s death forced police to change the strategy.“As soon as we realized he had committed an act that seemed to be random … we put the flier out,” Worley said. “And just as we thought, as soon as he saw the flier, he tried to elude capture and turned off all devices we were able to track him on.”A multi-agency task force managed to find and capture Billingsley on Wednesday night, Worley said. Billingsley was arrested at a train station in Bowie, Maryland, Deputy US Marshal Albert Maresca Jr. toldCNN affiliate WBAL . Bowie is about 25 miles southwest of downtown Baltimore.‘Rapists shouldn’t be let out early’ LaPere’s death ignited criticism over why Billingsley was allowed out on the streets at all. Billingsley pleaded guilty to first-degree assault in 2009 and second-degree assault in 2011, according to court records. In 2015, he was convicted of a first-degree sex offense and was initially sentenced to 30 years in prison (with 16 months already served), court records show. But he was released from prison about seven years later, in October 2022. His release was not parole, but rather “on mandatory supervision as required by statute” a spokesperson for Maryland’s Department of Public Safety and Correctional Servicestold The New York Times . Since his release from prison last year, Billingsley has been registered as a sex offender in Maryland’s statewide database. But “when we look at the facts of the original case, you will agree that he should not have been out on the streets,” Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott said Thursday. “Rapists shouldn’t be let out early – period. When you rape someone, no matter if it’s someone’s daughter, son, their wife, you should not get out early.” Even the top local prosecutor questioned Billingsley’s release from prison.“We immediately went back, we pulled the file,” said Ivan J. Bates, who became thestate’s attorney for Baltimore Citythis year. He said the outcome appeared to be “a little bit below guidelines.”“It was a different administration,” Bates said. “That prosecutor is no longer there. But with every single case, there are different issues that you have to look at. Are the witnesses, the victims cooperative? What’s the evidence? Things like that. So I’m not going to go back and say hindsight is 20/20.” But the prosecutor said he would like lawmakers to consider stricter rules for everyone convicted of sexual offenses – not just those who commit such acts against minors. Bates said in 2016, the state legislature passed a law saying a person who commits a sex offense against someone 16 or younger would not be eligible fordiminution credits– credits earned from good behavior or work that can reduce prison time. Bates suggested the “legislature could maybe look at the first-degree sex offense or first-degree rape, are these individuals still going to be eligible for diminution credits?”Detectives are now poring over the city’s cases since October to determine whether Billingsley may be connected to any other incidents since he was released,police said .LaPere’s legacy will be felt ‘for years to come’On Thursday, LaPere’s family released a statement thanking authorities for their work in capturing Billingsley. “We appreciate the tireless efforts of the Baltimore Police Department, and their law enforcement partners, throughout the course of this investigation and apprehension of the suspect,” the family said. “We’re relieved to know he can no longer hurt other innocent victims. While this doesn’t change that Baltimore lost one of its most passionate, influential fans, our efforts remain focused on remembering and celebrating Pava Marie – her life, successes, and legacy.”At a vigil for LaPere Wednesday evening, mourners remembered her as a rising tech entrepreneur who had a reputation for uplifting and connecting those in her Baltimore community. Pava LaPere's father, Frank LaPere, is joined by his wife Caroline and son Nico as he speaks during a vigil on Wednesday. Stephanie Scarbrough/APHer father, Frank LaPere, became tearful as he described his daughter growing up as “the definition of daddy’s little girl.” The father described how he proudly watched as Pava tapped into her innate leadership ability and relentlessly pursued her goals.Pava LaPere cofounded EcoMap at age 21 while she was still attending college at Johns Hopkins University, according to the company’s website. The startup, which sells artificial intelligence tools, has since grown to over 30 employees and announced nearly $8 million in financing this year. LaPere’s accomplishments earned her a spot on Forbes’30 Under 30 listearlier this year for social impact. The father and daughter – both early risers – would talk early in the morning and exchange photos of their sunrises, her father recalled. Pava would get to work early because she was a “workaholic” like her father, Frank said. LaPere’s dedication to supporting young entrepreneurs and building a tech community in Baltimore means she has left behind a legacy that won’t be easily forgotten, said Kory Bailey, who described LaPere as his friend and mentor. “The impact of who she is, what she means to us and what she created in this world will be felt, it will be carried forward and it will be recognized for years to come,” said Bailey, the chief ecosystem and relationship officer at UpSurge Baltimore, a company that helps startups to develop.LaPere’s father thanked the vigil attendees for supporting his daughter’s dreams.“We’re going to take her away from Baltimore, but her presence will never leave here,” he said. “Thank you very, very much for loving our girl.”CNN’s Elizabeth Wolfe, Emma Tucker, Andy Rose, Christine Sever and Jamiel Lynch contributed to this report.","Slain Baltimore CEO died of strangulation and blunt force trauma, court documents say",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/09/28/us/baltimore-tech-ceo-killing-suspect-arrest-pava-lapere-thursday/index.html
Francesca Street,"CNN — Ruben Flowers stumbled across the photo by accident.It was early 2023 and he was thumbing through photo albums at his grandmother’s house. Suddenly, there it was: a snapshot from 1994, taken in an airplane flight deck, depicting him as a toddler, sitting next to his pilot dad.In this picture, Flowers is looking at his dad in admiration. His father smiles at the camera, ready to fly the plane.Flowers had forgotten the photo existed, but seeing it again, he was flooded with memories of growing up, inspired by his father. He’d loved their trips to the airport, tagging along to the training center, taking a go on the simulators. He’d beamed with pride when his dad talked about his job at the school careers day.And the timing of the rediscovered photo was perfect: Flowers, now 30, was just about to follow in his father’s footsteps and begin flying as a First Officer for Southwest Airlines.Meanwhile Flowers’ father – also called Ruben Flowers – was nearing retirement and readying for his final Southwest flight as Captain.The two men were excited to briefly overlap at Southwest and hoped they’d get an opportunity to fly together.“It was a dream of mine to make it to this point to fly with my dad, it was probably my number one aviation goal,” the younger Flowers tellsCNN Travel. “It was a dream of mine to make it to this point to fly with my dad, it was probably my number one aviation goal.”First Officer Ruben Flowers After rediscovering the old photo, the two Flowers men added a coda to the goal: not only did they want to fly together, they wanted to recreate the 1990s flight deck photo, over two decades later. Not just as father and son, but as colleagues and co-pilots.Cut to March 2023 and the older Flowers was flying his final Southwest flight, piloting an aircraft from Omaha, Nebraska to his home city of Chicago, Illinois. His son was by his side, as his first officer.“That was an awesome feeling,” says the older Flowers. “To look over there and see my son, next to me, for my last landing.”And, naturally, they recreated the 1994 photo, both grinning happily in the 2023 version.“It was just great to be able to recreate that moment,” says the younger Flowers. “It was a dream come true moment.”Family affair Here's Captain Ruben Flowers and First Officer Ruben Flowers recreating the 1990s photo in 2023. Courtesy Southwest AirlinesAlso on board the older Flowers’ retirement flight was his brother and his cousin, who both work for Southwest too. In case you hadn’t realized by now, flying truly is a family affair for the Flowers.“There are seven of us,” explains the older Flowers. “Me. My brother’s a pilot. I have three kids, all pilots. And my brother’s son is a pilot and my cousin is a pilot. And it’s just amazing to me that they all wanted to be pilots.”At family events and on holidays, the Flowers family try to keep work talk to a minimum “but there’s always a story that sparks it off, and then it gets into aviation,” as the younger Flowers puts it. The Flowers family aviation legacy began when the older Flowers was a kid growing up in Michigan in the 1960s and 70s.“A pilot one day asked me if I wanted to come up to the cockpit. And I did it,” he recalls. “And oh, my God, it was like the bug bit me – I wanted to be a pilot. And from that point on, I just focused on being an airline pilot.”Once he qualified, the older Flowers made it his mission to inspire others to follow in his footsteps. The fact that ended up including many of his loved ones was accidental. He says he always encouraged his kids to explore whatever they loved, whatever that might be.The younger Flowers says that while he grew up in awe of his dad and proud of his work, he didn’t officially decide to become an aviator until midway through college.Looking back now though, he thinks the signs were always pointing in that direction.“It was always something that was probably in the back of my head that I probably wanted to do all my life,” he says. An aviation-loving kid posed by an airplane in 1999. Over 20 years later, she recreated the photo Working as a team The Flowers men say they worked well together as a father-son pilot team. Courtesy Southwest AirlinesThe older Flowers’ retirement flight was always going to be emotional, and having his son by his side only made it more so. He says it’s not surprising that when they pulled into the gate “some tears came down.”The younger Flowers says the in-air, father-son working dynamic wasn’t dissimilar from “doing the lawn together, or something of that nature.”“It just worked out smooth and naturally, and it went great,” he says, although he adds he was definitely trying to “impress” his dad with his skills and competency.The older Flowers says he was aware the flight was a one-off opportunity for him to pass on flying intel to his son in situ.“It went really well, it was nice and smooth,” he says of the experience. “And it was an awesome feeling – making a PA to the passengers, and they find out there’s a father and son up there in the cockpit. Everybody clapping…” What happened when a 94-year-old former flight attendant saw a photo of herself at the airport Continuing legacy Captain Ruben Flowers has now retired from Southwest, but hopes to continue inspiring other aviators. Courtesy Southwest AirlinesWhile the older Flowers has now left Southwest, his legacy lives on at the airline – not only via his son, but via other aviators he worked with and mentored over the years.Flowers speaks fondly of his own mentor, Louis Freeman, who became Southwest Airlines first Black pilot when he was hired in 1980.“He was a mentor to me,” says the older Flowers of Freeman. “And now I’m trying to be a mentor to others. And I hope my son can be a mentor to others, not just family members.”While at Southwest, Flowers was part of the airline’s Adopt-A-Pilot program, working with elementary school kids to inspire them to explore careers in aviation.He’s also a longtime member of the Organization of Black Aerospace Professionals (OBAP), where he works to uplift Black aviators.He encourages prospective pilots to do their research online, look out for programmes, and speak to anyone and everyone they can to get inspiration, information and advice.The younger Flowers echoes this – he’s actively involved in mentoring young pilots via social media, but he’s also had the occasional in-person conversation with a prospective pilot while transiting through the airport. He says if he can, he’ll always stop and pass on a few words of wisdom between flights.“That was an awesome feeling. To look over there and see my son, next to me, for my last landing.”Captain Ruben Flowers As for his own personal goals, now that he’s achieved his dream of flying with his father, the younger Flowers next dream is to fly side-by-side with his younger brother, who has just recently completed pilot training.He’s already had the pleasure of flying with his pilot sister several years ago and says it would be incredible if he could complete the family trifecta.“That’s what I’m looking forward to, is to be able to fly in the plane with my brother,” he says.The older Flowers is excited for that day too, and says he’s unendingly proud of his three children.“It’s unbelievable,” he says. “It’s an awesome feeling to know that my son is flying, and my daughter and my youngest son, all three of them are flyers.” ",A kid posed with his pilot dad in an airplane.

Alex Rees," New York CityCNN — Few fashion labels conjure a picturesque — and aspirational — vision of gilded Americana quite like Ralph Lauren.The brand captures and diffuses the pillars of a certain kind of luxe lifestyle: Countryside retreats with equestrian flair, coastal getaways with cable-knit jumpers tied around necks and sand on floorboards, debonair evenings in New York or old Hollywood with sharp tailoring and classic lines, and a kind of timeless, pragmatic appeal that signals money — but doesn’t shout it.With 56 years at the helm under his western-buckled belt, it can be said that Ralph Lauren himself was way, way ahead of his time: The kind of world-building he pioneered is now de rigueur for brands hoping to survive in a fashion industry where the values and semiotic associations of one’s products are almost more important than the products themselves. Even on the subtlest level, shoppers are buying intostories , not just sweaters or suits. In this climate, Lauren’s outlook — clairvoyance, even — has paid dividends. While quintessentially American, the Ralph Lauren aesthetic engages fashion consumers not just domestically but worldwide. Giovanni Giannoni/WWD/Penske Media/Getty Images“I build worlds out of dreams,” Lauren told CNN in a rare interview, via email, just days after he returned to the New York Fashion Week calendar following a four-year hiatus. “And that in itself has limitless possibilities.”Limitless — and lucrative. The company reported revenues of $6.2 billion for the fiscal year of 2022, thanks largely to its robust women’s and men’s ready-to-wear clothing collections, children’s clothing line accessories, fragrances and home and decor ranges. Within these are subcategories: the famed Polo Ralph Lauren, which focuses on more affordable and casual clothing, Purple Label, the company’s most luxurious offering, and Polo Sport, among others.In the past decade, the company has added popular restaurants in New York, Chicago and France to its hospitality portfolio, “because I believe in sharing my world,” Lauren explained. (Polo Bar is still one of the hottest tables in New York.) He has also launched Ralph’s Coffee, a cafe chain now found in locations ranging from Madison Avenue to Munich to Malaysia. Ralph Lauren also amplifies sponsorships that both align with its brand outlook and enhance it, one example being the tennis world, where it hosts a flagship viewing suite at both Wimbledon and the US Open. Serving looks: See inside the exclusive hair salon for tennis players at the US Open “I started (my company) with a tie,” Lauren said of his beginnings in the business, when he famously convinced his then-employers at menswear brand Beau Brummell to let him launch his own line of neckties. “And then (I) added collections for men, women, children and home… I never had a plan. These things just happen naturally.”When asked what additional categories he might want to bring to the Ralph Lauren universe, he added: “I never know what’s missing until it presents itself to me in a personal way.”For Spring-Summer 2024, Lauren certainly embraced the personal. Until this week, the label had not held a show at New York Fashion Week since 2019, when it hosted a makeshift supper club alongside its runway— guests wore black-tie and Janelle Monáe performed, at one point flinging champagne into the air. (During the pandemic years, the brand activated a series of exclusive and smaller — but no less spectacular — events off the fashion calendar.)

Nick Thomsen/Courtesy Ralph LaurenSo powerful is the brand among editors and fans alike that, simply by returning to the New York Fashion Week calendar, the label breathed new energy into the “usual” show circuit. Indeed, it turned a warehouse in the Brooklyn Naval Yard into one of the week’s most exclusive venues.Guests arrived at the space to find it transformed into what the brand described as a “reimagined artist’s loft.” “Glimmering chandeliers, artfully draped canvas, and organic textures of reclaimed wood, plaster, and fine muslin imbue the rustic setting with a romantic spirit,” a press release explained.

Evan Agostini/Invision/APThe celebrities in attendance at Ralph Lauren's Spring-Summer 2024 runway showPrev NextAcross nearly 50 looks, the collection embodied — and shrewdly juxtaposed — the seeming breadth of that hypothetical artist’s creativity and inspiration. It opened with a series of denim pieces, many embellished with embroidery, rhinestones and floral detailing. Similarly softened takes on suiting and a few military jackets followed, before the looks segued into a bold black and gold color palette. (At this point, a standout piece arrived in the form of a shimmering gold reimagining of the classic Ralph Lauren polo shirt, paired with a sequined black tulle maxi skirt.)From there, a kaleidoscope of jeweled colors— topaz blue, citrine yellow, emerald green and garnet red among them — closed out the show on bias-draped gowns and fringed blouses, with a final pop of gold returningfor the closing look, worn by supermodel Christy Turlington.“All the clothes in my Spring 2024 collection are familiar, like a military jacket that I’ve always loved, but worn with gold jeans,” Lauren reflected. “I love contradictions. Fashion, to me, is not about looking back or looking forward. It’s about liking what you like.” A detail shot from the collection highlights its floral detailing on denim pieces, and the brand's new RL 888 handbag. Courtesy Ralph Lauren Strands of chunky beading and gems are layered atop a multicolored check bandeau top. Courtesy Ralph LaurenFollowing the runway show, a pair of barn-style doors within the warehouse set were opened to reveal a restaurant space that read simultaneously opulent and understated — the classic RL dichotomy, distilled again — for the evening’s dinner. This staging was inspired by Lauren’s Colorado ranch, the brand noted; the menu comprised of classic Polo Bar dishes including the classic “Ralph’s Brownie à la Mode” for dessert.Speaking with CNN over dinner, Ralph Lauren himself demurred when asked if he considered his return to New York Fashion Week a particular homecoming moment for his brand. “I’m always in New York,” he explained, motioning to his heart. “I grew up here.”He cited the city as “a melting pot,” and thus a home in particular for some of the themes in the night’s collection — “bohemian Americana glamour,” as he put it. In many respects, he explained, New York City is an embodiment of his mindset; a city “steeped in history, but celebrating what’s next,” he said. “It’s always about celebrating the new, and the news.” New York Fashion Week: Highlights from the Spring-Summer 2024 runways “There are things that are always relevant because they’re not about fashion,” said Lauren over email. “(They’re) about personal style. That’s what I’ve always believed.” To this point, he highlighted classic car designs and equestrian culture cowboy dressing — both of which he loves, and both of which, while fashionable, are rooted in a sensibility that’s deeper and less fleeting than clothes alone. In this sense, he might be viewed more as a lifestyle curator and architect than a fashion designer. A Ralph Lauren store in Central London. Alex Segre/UCG/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesPerhaps what’s helped make the brand continually resonant is that Lauren’s tastes have remained steadfast since, well, its inception. He is both devoutly true to his own aesthetic and endlessly confident of its resonance in the consumer culture space; in turn, he has helped make those preferences mainstream. Ralph Lauren’s products may gently nod to trends, but it’salwaysRL first, and dominantly so.“My vision hasn’t changed. I don’t want what I created in 1967 to be old or what I sent down the runway last week to be new. I believe in timelessness,” Lauren said. “What has always stayed the same is my love of things that are authentic… The way I design never changes.” ",My vision hasnt changed.

"Oscar Holland,Christy Choi","CNN — Hollywood’s red carpets have beeneerily quietamid the ongoing actors’ and writers’ strikes, but the music industry was out in full force at this year’sVideo Music Awards(VMAs).

" Jacqui Palumbo, CNN","CNN — Ariana Grande has revealed she’s taken a hiatus from lip fillers and Botox injections in recent years.Grande’s comments came during avideomade for Vogue about her beauty secrets, during which she got candid — and emotional — about how her relationship with beauty has shifted over time.The singer and the actor has not previously disclosed undergoing any cosmetic procedures. Having grown up in the spotlight, and thus dealt with public scrutiny over her appearance from a young age, she said, “it’s really hard to know what’s worth hearing and not.” Florence Pugh says people are scared of the ‘freedom’ she feels with her body While applying makeup for the video, Grande, now aged 30, explained that she had often embellished her beauty looks with bigger hair or thicker eyeliner “as a disguise or something to hide behind,” but as she gets older she doesn’t “love that being the intention behind it anymore,” thinking of it “as self-expression and accentuating what is there” instead.Similarly, she continued, she used cosmetic procedures in the same way. “I had a ton of lip filler over the years, and Botox. I stopped in 2018 because I felt so — too much,” she said. “For a long time, beauty was about hiding for me and now I feel like maybe it’s not.” Grande said that she used to use makeup and cosmetic procedures as “something to hide behind,” but doesn't feel that way anymore. Karwai Tang/WireImage/Getty Images“I want to see my well-earned cry lines and smile lines,” she continued. “I hope my smile lines get deeper and deeper and I laugh more and more. Aging can be such a beautiful thing.”A rare admissionThough the prevalence of injectables and other treatments among famous faces is an open secret in Hollywood, it’s unusual for celebrities to be forthcoming about how they’ve altered their appearance — even with less invasive, more widely accepted procedures.Some stars, like Chrissy Teigen and Cindy Crawford, have been honest about cosmetic enhancements. This year, Blac Chyna has taken such candor even further, turning to social media to document the months-long process of dissolving facial fillers in her lips, cheeks and jaw. Tell-all book lifts the lid on troubled beauty brand Glossier Grande is part of an increasing number of young patients who have undergone cosmetic enhancements. According to asurveyfrom the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, 27% of patients receiving Botox injections in 2022 were age 34 or younger, up 6% from 2015. And 75%of facial plastic surgeons reported a rise in the number of patients under 30 seeking cosmetic surgery or injectables — a notable year-on-year increase, as a similar percentage of surgeons had also said they’d seen increased interest in 2021.Grande told Vogue that she hasn’t necessarily sworn off injectables or surgeries forever. “Now, might I get a face lift in 10 years? I might, yeah,” she said with a laugh. “But these are just thoughts we should be able to discuss. If we’re talking about beauty secrets… F*** it let’s put it all out there.” ","Ariana Grande reveals she had a ton of lip filler and Botox, but stopped years ago",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/09/13/style/ariana-grande-lip-filler-botox-vogue/index.html
Ivana Kottasová," Atlas Mountains, MoroccoCNN — Khadija Ait Si Ali was just starting to rebuild her life when the earthquake struck. Her husband died in a road accident seven months ago. They had been married for less than a year and she was five months pregnant. “I was planning to start looking for a job in two or three months,” she told CNN, standing in therubble of Tinzert , a tiny village in the Atlas Mountains that was leveled by last Friday’s quake.“I thought that’s all I needed. But now I need a house. Because we don’t have a house.” Ait Si Ali and her 3-month-old baby have few options for help; everyone else here is also dealing with their own circumstances. “My mother lost her house. Everyone in my family lost their houses. My husband’s family’s house is almost gone,” the 26-year-old said.It’s a common story in this remote, rugged area of Morocco. Most people here live where they were born, where their ancestors have lived for centuries. Family is never too far. When the devastating earthquake struck the region, people’s vital support networks collapsed along with everything else. The sheer number of people who have lost their homes means that, even a full week after the disaster, many are still without shelter, surviving out in the open under makeshift tents made of blankets or pieces of tarp.With the winter approaching these mountainous villages soon, therecovery and rebuildingneeds to start immediately.Amal Zniber runs the Moroccan educational charity Amis Des Écoles and has spent the past week distributing aid around the region. She said that due to the generosity of people from across the country there is now enough food and water, but waste is becoming a problem. “We need find ways to get rid of the waste and figure out how best to supply kitchens, toilets, showers (and) sleeping arrangements that are compatible with local culture and customs,” Zniber told CNN. Abdu Brahim and his wife Hanan Ait Brahim sort through the items they recovered from the rubble of their home, where their 7-year-old daughter died. Ivana Kottasová/CNNIn the village of Tafeghaghte, about an hour and a half southwest of Marrakech, Abdu Brahim told CNN his family is still trying to find ways to stay warm and dry.“We need a tent and something to cook in. The dew makes everything wet in the morning. I need a tent for my children and my father, he is very old,” he said.Abdu Brahim and his wife Hanan Ait Brahim have spent the past few days sifting through the pile of rubble that used to be their home. Their 7-year-old daughter was killed in the earthquake, alongside her aunt, uncle and cousin who lived in the house next door. The couple tried to salvage anything they could from the rubble, sorting their dusty, damaged possessions into piles. Clothes and shoes. Kitchen items. Blankets and mattresses. “I am just trying to organize it all to see what we have and what we need,” Hanan Ait said. Fatema Acherhri lost her two daughters, Rajaa and Sanaa, in the earthquake. Ivana Kottasova/CNNThis entire village was wiped out 'in just 10 seconds' in Morocco's devastating earthquake They worked methodically, in silence. At one point, Hanan Ait came across pencils and chalks that belonged to her daughter and tears started flooding her eyes.The 51 people killed by the quake in this 500-strong community have been buried on the edge of the village. Their graves are one reason why Abdu Brahim said he cannot imagine leaving Tafeghaghte, despite the devastation. “Our life is here. We have land here, we have animals here,” he said. “When I think of all of the happiness in my life, it’s all here,” he added. He told CNN he was determined to rebuild a home for his family. “Little by little,” he said. It took him 20 years to build the house first time around; now he is starting from scratch, without the support of his brother. The Moroccan government announced Thursday that people whose homes were completely destroyed will be eligible for 140,000 dirhams ($14,000) in assistance. Those with partially damaged homes will be eligible for 80,000 dirhams and everyone else who was impacted by the quake will receive 30,000 dirhams.Abdelkarim Ait Amkhaine’s home in the nearby town of Ouirgane was destroyed in the quake and he has spent the past few days sleeping in a tent. He told CNN the financial assistance would be a significant help for people living in the mountains.“140,000 dirhams is a reasonable amount to be able to rebuild a home. It is the minimum requirement to build a modest home,” he said, adding that his house is so badly damaged it will have to be torn down and cleared away before any new construction can start. The village of Tafeghaghte was completely leveled in the earthquake on Friday, September 8. Ivana Kottasová/CNNDestroyed homes, crushed soulsIt’s not just the enormous physical damage that is hurting people here. Khadija Ait Si Ali said she can still hear the terrible sound of the earthquake. “You cannot imagine how strong it was… A horrible noise, like something was exploding, but I didn’t know what. Like there was a war, but it wasn’t a war. Believe me, I thought it was the end of the world,” she said. The moment keeps coming back to her. “During the day, we are OK, but believe me, at night, it’s scary. It’s very scary because that night, everything was OK and suddenly it happen(ed). And I am afraid it will happen again. Even when I am very tired, I can’t sleep, I keep waking up. I am up at 11, I am up at 12, I am up at 1, I am always waking up, waiting for it to happen,” Ait Si Ali said.Dr. Adil Akanour has seen this in a lot of his patients in the past few days. Akanour is a psychiatrist who has been deployed to a field hospital in Asni, a town also in the Atlas Mountains, alongside therapists and social workers.Residents of Moulay Brahim look at the remains of a hotel where Sami Sensis parents were staying when the earthquake struck. Ivana Kottasová/CNNMoroccan earthquake survivors left to fend for themselves in the Atlas Mountains “There is a huge need (for psychological support), and, thankfully, much more recognition of the need than in the past,” Akanour told CNN in the field hospital’s psychiatric tent. A military doctor, he has experience in disaster and conflict zones. “People need to process the situation but we also try to help them prepare for the future, because it will take a long time to recover,” he said.The rebuilding might take a lot longer than many of the victims can imagine. The United Nations said that six months after February’s devastating earthquake in Turkey and Syria, more than 9 million people are still in need of support. According to data from Action Against Hunger, of the 3 million people who fled their homes because of the earthquake in Turkey, 1.5 million are still living in temporary settlements.Akanour saw dozens of traumatized patients in the first few days after the earthquake. Fatme Akia Nayet, an elderly Berber woman whose village was badly impacted, has been repeating the names of all the people she knew who have died. Every time someone entered the hospital tent she was resting in, Akia Nayet started again. Fatme Akia Nayet is being treated in the Asni field hospital. She repeats the names of people she knows have died.

Whenever she tried to speak, she began to cry.Mariam Maroi was badly injured and pulled out of the rubble. She does not recall anything from the night of the earthquake. Ivana Kottasová/CNNOthers were angry about the situation. In Moulay Brahim, a village not far from Asni, tensions were running high last Sunday, as the community kept waiting for official help to arrive. At one point, stones flew through the air, as an argument between two groups of people from the village reached boiling point. Back in Tinzert, Khadija Ait Si Ali said that for now, she was just trying to focus on her baby and get through each day. “When it just happened, I knew I had to take my baby out of the house… She was in her bed and as I was getting to her, the house was falling in front of me. I lost my husband and I am looking at my baby and I am so afraid I will lose her too. She is all I have,” she said.Ait Si Ali said she felt lost with nobody to turn to. “I was planning to start looking for a job. But now I don’t know what to do. I am just waiting,” she added.CNN’s Celine Alkhaldi and Eyad Kourdi contributed reporting. ",Moroccos quake survivors must rebuild their homes and lives.

Story by Reuters," The family of late American pipeline billionaire George Lindemann has agreed to return 33 looted artifacts to Cambodia, according to the US Attorney’s Office, a decision described as “momentous” by the Southeast Asian country.The collection includes statues of deities, angels and demons from the 10th and 12th centuries from Koh Ker, the ancient capital of the Khmer kingdom, and from the famous Angkor Wat temple, the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York said on Tuesday.In a statement it said the family’s decision to return the artifacts was voluntary. Lawyers for the Lindemann family did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Dhrishtadyumna from Koh Ker U.S. Attorney's Office, Southern District of New YorkCambodia’s archaeological sites suffered widespread looting during civil conflicts from the 1960s to 1990s and its government has spent years pursuing the return of antiquities, some of which it says are on display in American museums.The United States repatriated 27 smuggled antiquities to Cambodia in 2021, including Hindu and Buddhist statues valued at about $3.8 million and last year returned 30 more including several that were more than 1,000 years old.The artifacts that were held by the Lindemann family are expected to be repatriated later this year, said Bradley Gordon, a lawyer advising Cambodia on the repatriations and head of its investigation team. Italy repatriates looted ancient artifacts from the US He said he understood the Lindemann family had paid more than $20 million for the artifacts.Cambodia’s Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts in a statement said the Lindemann family’s decision to return the artifacts set “an excellent and proper example for other museums and private collectors.”In a June speech to the American Chamber of Commerce, two months before becoming Cambodia’s leader, Prime Minister Hun Manet said the antiquities were national treasures and more than just historical relics.“They are the blood in our veins and the soul in our hearts that forge the identity of being Khmer… our heritages define who we are and who we will be,” he said.US authorities have spent more than a decade working on locating artifacts from Cambodia and have so far repatriated 65. In 2019, art dealer Douglas Latchford was indicted for wire fraud and other crimes related to selling looted Cambodian artifacts, but the charges were dismissed after his death.

Jordan Valinsky," New YorkCNN — McDonald’s is being sued over a hot coffee spill, again.This time, a San Francisco location is being accused of serving a “scalding” cup of coffee with an improperly attached lid, which allegedly resulted in the coffee pouring out on plaintiff Mable Childress’ body and causing “severe burns” after she tried drinking it. The lawsuit, filed last week, alleged that the elderly woman is suffering from “physical pains, emotional distress and other damages.” The restaurant’s negligence was a “substantial factor” for her injuries, it alleged.Childress also said in the lawsuit that the restaurant employees “refused” to help her, a point that the McDonald’s denied.“We take every customer complaint seriously and when Childress reported her experience to us later that day, our employees and management team spoke to her within a few minutes and offered assistance,” the McDonald’s franchisee owner, Peter Ou, said in a statement to CNN.“My restaurants have strict food safety protocols in place, including training crew to ensure lids on hot beverages are secure,” Ou said, adding that the company is “reviewing this new legal claim in detail.”This case echoes thefamous McDonald’s hot coffeelawsuit several decades ago, in which another woman spilled coffee on her lap and suffered third-degree burns. Third-degree burns are the most severe and penetrate through the entire skin.A jury in 1992 agreed with her contention that the coffee wasunreasonably hot , which it was, according to the American Museum of Tort Law. The coffee was “30 to 40 degrees hotter than coffee served by other companies,” the law museum said. The plaintiff in that case was initially awarded nearly $3 million, but she settled for less, around $480,000 after an appeal.Earlier this year, McDonald’s was found liable in another case involving hot food. AFlorida jury awarded a family $800,000in a civil lawsuit against McDonald’s and one of its franchisees after a toddler was burned by hot chicken nuggets. The jury found franchise owner Upchurch Foods was liable for failing to properly warn or provide reasonable instructions on the possible harm from the hot McNuggets served at a Miami-area location.McDonald’s in a statement called it an “unfortunate incident” but that they “respectfully disagree with the verdict.” Its defense said it had no control over the injuries and damages.

Melanie Radzicki McManus,"Editor’s note:Before beginning any new exercise program, consult your doctor. Stop immediately if you experience pain.CNN — If you enjoy walking for exercise, there’s a simple way to maximize your efforts — change your walk into a ruck. Rucking is walking with weight on your back, and it’s an increasingly popular form of exercise.“I see people rucking in my neighborhood all the time now,” said former US Navy SEAL Stew Smith, a fitness instructor and coach for the special ops training team at the US Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland.A beautiful senior Mexican Woman working out and stretching with weights adamkaz/E+/Getty ImagesWhat’s more important as you age — stretching, balance work or strength training? The term “rucking” comes from ruck marching, a core skill used by militaries around the world. One of the tests the US Army gives recruits looking to earn an Expert Infantryman Badge is a12-mile ruck , or foot march, which they must complete within three hours while carryingat least 35 pounds of gear . But you can start with a lighter load and gradually add weight as you develop strength.One of the reasons rucking is growing in popularity may be due to the fact that it’s an easy, low-impact, all-body exercise that boosts cardiovascular and muscular health.One small September 2019 studyshowed 10 weeks of weighted walking andresistance trainingimproved physical performance in men while significantly reducing their rate of perceived exertion.Weighted step training improved lower-limb muscle power and functional ability in older women,another study from January 2019 found , indicating the exercise could potentially prolong their independence by almost 10 years.Close-up of sportsmen in sneakers running up on the stairs during training outdoors SeventyFour/iStockphoto/Getty ImagesAs few as 4,000 steps a day can reduce your risk of death, but more is better What’s more, rucking torches calories. A person burns 30% to 45% more calories with weighted walking than when strolling sans backpack, Smith said. A 180-pound soldier carrying 35 pounds while walking 15 minutes per mile for 3.7 miles (6 kilometers) burns680 calories , according to the US Army. Since, in general, the more you weigh, the more calories expended during any activity, that 180-pound soldier is burning calories at the rate of someone who weighs 215 pounds.“It’s a simple math equation,” said Mark Stephenson, seniordirector at the Center for Sports Performance and Research at Mass General Brigham in Foxborough, Massachusetts . Another bonus: Since rucking is typically performed outdoors, it’s also good for your mental health. “There are lots ofstudies showing the mental health benefitsof being in a natural environment are huge, so if rucking gives you a purpose to be outside, that’s some encouragement I’d use,” Stephenson said.How to ruckWhile rucking is simple — walking with a backpack — there are several things to keep in mind before you grab your pack and head outside. First, don’t be too ambitious. As with any new exercise, you’ll need to begin slowly.“Start with an empty backpack and walk a distance you’ve already done,” Stephenson said. “When you start adding weight to your pack, try something low, like 10% of your body weight. Adding weight is going to put more stress on your ankles, knees, hips and back, so do it gradually.” Start slowly and don't be too ambitious when you begin rucking, experts say. Use an empty backpack and do a distance you have already done. urbazon/E+/Getty ImagesAnother option is to start with a weighted vest instead of a backpack. This distributes the weight between your front and back. Once you’re accustomed to the vest, you can switch to a backpack. But you shouldn’t use any old pack.Rucksacks should have wide, padded shoulder straps. “Don’t put weight in a string bag,” Smith said. “Most straps are not made to hold 10, 20 or more pounds, and the skinny straps will really rip up your shoulders.”It’s also important that your pack has a waist strap, which helps minimize its movement and more evenly distributes the weight, which should be tight against your back and not pulling away from the shoulders.Beautiful black woman exercising outdoors in New York City Michele Pevide/E+/Getty ImagesCertain conditions can impact how much exercise you need to ease depression, study finds While it may be tempting to chuck canned food or dumbbells into your pack to achieve the desired weight, that’s not the best idea, he added. Heavy items should be centered in the middle of your back near the shoulder blades, not at the bottom of the pack near your lower back. Sharp items can be uncomfortable, too.Smith prefers using a bag of sand, which you can purchase at a hardware store. Ideally, the load will evenly fill your pack. Specially madefitness sandbagsare available, too. “Sand can mold into your back, versus metal digging into your spine,” Smith said.If you want to take the worry out of selecting the proper backpack and weights, purchase a backpack specifically made for rucking. These may come with weighted plates or sandbags, plus pockets to hold them in the proper position. Some rucksacks have handles on the exterior if you wish to pause during your ruck to perform some exercises, such as squatting while holding your sack above your head.Don’t forget your feet, Smith said. Select a comfortable pair of shoes paired with socks made of wool or another wicking material, which will help prevent blisters.Additional considerationsWhile most people can ruck if they can walk, it’s not advisable for everyone. “If you have shoulder problems, tendinitis or stiffness, putting on a weighted backpack is only going to exacerbate that,” Stephenson said. “If I walk 2miles and my knee is sore, it will be more sore if I put weight on.”More than 80% of US adults aren't meeting the federal government's muscle-strengthening guidelines. Adobe StockOver 80% of adults don't meet US strength guidelines. Don't forget these muscles Fitness experts recommend rucking just a few times per week, not daily. It can also help to pair your rucks with lower-body exercises. The students Smith coaches at the US Naval Academy ruck twice a week, for example, and their workouts include rucking around a track and up and down bleachers, interspersed with lunges and squats.But you can also just ruck around your neighborhood. “It’s not that complicated,” Stephenson said. “Just be smart about it. You’re looking for an activity that’s challenging but doesn’t push you over the line. If it hurts, then it’s not good.” Melanie Radzicki McManusis a freelance writer who specializes in hiking, travel and fitness.",Rucking is an easy way to fitness,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/09/16/health/rucking-cardio-strength-workout-wellness/index.html

Catherine Thorbecke,"CNN — You can now speak aloud to ChatGPT and hear the artificial intelligence-powered chatbot talk back.OpenAI, the startup behind the wildly-popular chatbot, announced Monday that it is rolling out new features including the ability to let users engage in a back-and-forth voice conversation with ChatGPT. In acompany blog postMonday, OpenAI teased how this new feature can be used to “request a bedtime story for your family, or settle a dinner table debate.” The new voice features from OpenAI carry similarities to those currently offered by Amazon’s Alexa or Apple’s Siri voice assistants. In a demo of the new update shared by OpenAI, a user asks ChatGPT to come up with a story about “the super-duper sunflower hedgehog named Larry.” The chatbot is able to narrate a story out loud with a human-sounding voice that can also respond to questions, such as, “What was his house like?” and “Who is his best friend?”ChatGPT’s voice capability is “powered by a new text-to-speech model, capable of generating human-like audio from just text and a few seconds of sample speech,” Open AI said in the blogpost. The company added that it collaborated with professional voice actors to create the five different voices that can be used to animate the chatbot.

For example, you can snap a picture of the contents of your fridge and ask ChatGPT to help you come up with a meal plan using the ingredients you have. Moreover, the company said you can ask the chatbot to focus on a specific part of an image with its “drawing tool” in the app. The new features roll out in the app within the next two weeks for paying subscribers of ChatGPT’s Plus and Enterprise services. (Subscriptions to the Plus service are $20 a month, and its Enterprise service is currently only offered to business clients).The updates from OpenAI come amid an ongoing AI arms race within the tech sector, initially spurred by the public launch of ChatGPT late last year.

Alicia Wallace," MinneapolisCNN —Buy Now, Pay Laterinstallment payment offerings appear to be disproportionately used by people facing financial difficulties, raising concerns about the potential for greater money trouble, according to research from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York released Tuesday. Buy Now, Pay Later offeringshave grown in popularity in recent yearsas a way to afford goods and services; however, the scale of thefast-growing financing programsand the debt incurred remain a virtual black box, as the segment remainslargely unregulatedand the information is not reported to credit agencies, lenders or government data-keepers. New York Fed researchers delved into recently collected consumer survey data to determine who is being offered BNPL options and who uses them. They drew on data collected as part of the June 2023 Survey of Consumer Expectations Credit Access Survey, which included a set of BNPL-specific questions.They found that the vast majority of consumers being offered BNPL and those who use the payment option are banked and cover a “remarkably broad-based” swath of demographics, with more users who identify as female, younger, renters, with higher household income; as well as those with lower credit scores and higher reported delinquencies.“Despite being fairly broad-based, with significant take-up among higher educated and higher income respondents, overall we find that those with lower credit scores and greater unmet credit needs make up a disproportionate share of all BNPL users,” researcherswrote Tuesday . The data showed that 32.7% of BNPL-using respondents had a credit score under 620, reported a rejected credit application or were delinquent on a loan in the past year. That group, however, represented only 16.6% of the overall sample. “The fact that a disproportionate share of BNPL users are already financially fragile raises questions about the resilience of BNPL lending and its performance following an adverse economic shock,” New York Fed researchers wrote. The New York Fed research substantiatespreviously raised concernsfrom critics that BNPL may attract — and could ultimately harm — financially fragile individuals. And that could ultimately negatively impact consumers at a time when they’re facing greater headwinds — including mounting credit card debt,strikingly high interest rates ,still-high inflation , aslowing job market , apotential government shutdown , and thereturn of student loan payments , New York Fed researchers said. “While our findings indicate that BNPL services enjoy broad-based interest, appear to fill a gap in the credit market, and expand credit access and financial inclusion, more data and analysis are needed to investigate the extent to which BNPL borrowing may contribute to greater financial stress and affect overall financial well-being, especially over the course of the business cycle,” they wrote.Five of the largest BNPL lenders originated $24.2 billion in the installment loans in 2021, according to theConsumer Financial Protection Bureau , but some estimates put the industry much higher.

Abu Dhabi, UAECNN — Dubai is rolling out its first round of robotaxis next month, as a part of a plan to alleviate congestion and accidents. Five fully autonomous electric taxis, operated by a General Motors subsidiary called Cruise, will begin test driving on an 8km (5 mile) stretch in the upscale Jumeirah district of the United Arab Emirates city, according to Ahmed Bahrozyan, the CEO of Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA).Dubai hopes to become the first Middle Eastern city to introduce driverless taxis, Bahrozyan said. Autonomous taxis currently operate in several cities around the world, mostly in the USand China.Cruise operates commercial robotaxis in US cities like San Francisco, but Dubai would be the first launch of the cars outside the US, Bahrozyan said. “We are doing our own set of tests and trials in Dubai… every city has its own characteristics,” Bahrozyan said in an interview with CNN. “We have weather conditions that are certainly different than the US.”videoDriverless taxi company ordered to cut fleet in half after crashes RTA plans to roll out 4,000 self-driving taxis by 2030, adding to the fleet of 12,000 traditional taxis in the city. Rides are expected to be slightly more expensive than an ordinary taxi but in the same price range as a private car like Uber. Cruise entered a contract with the RTA for 15 years, and after this period the taxi market may open up to competitors. Bahroyzyan said he foresees autonomous vehicles eventually making up the majority of the Middle East tourist hub’s taxi fleet.A year after GM’s Cruiserobotaxis were launched in California, the company was forced to cut its fleet in half in the state followinga series of collisions.The collisions outlined the potential challenges of driverless cars.

Brian Fung,"CNN — The US government and 17 states are suing Amazon in a landmark monopoly case reflecting years of allegations that the e-commerce giant abused its economic dominance and harmed fair competition.The groundbreaking lawsuit by the Federal Trade Commission and 17 attorneys general marks the government’s sharpest attack yet against Amazon, a company that started off selling books on the internet but has since become known as “the everything store,” expanding into selling a vast range of consumer products, creating a globe-spanning logistics network and becoming a powerhouse in other technologies such as cloud computing.The 172-pagecomplaintalleges Amazon unfairly promotes its own platform and services at the expense of third-party sellers who rely on the company’s e-commerce marketplace for distribution. For example, according to the FTC, Amazon has harmed competition by requiring sellers on its platform to purchase Amazon’s in-house logistics services in order to secure the best seller benefits, referred to as “Prime” eligibility. It also claims the company anticompetitively forces sellers to list their products on Amazon at the lowest prices anywhere on the web, instead of allowing sellers to offer their products at competing marketplaces for a lower price.That practice is already the subject of a separate lawsuit targeting Amazon filed by California’s attorney general last year. Because of Amazon’s dominance in e-commerce, sellers have little option but to accept Amazon’s terms, the FTC alleges, resulting in higher prices for consumers and a worse consumer experience. Amazon also ranks its own products in marketplace search results higher than those sold by third parties, the FTC said.Amazon is “squarely focused on preventing anyone else from gaining that same critical mass of customers,” FTC Chair Lina Khan told reporters Tuesday. “This complaint reflects the cutting edge and best thinking on how competition occurs in digital markets and, similarly, the tactics that Amazon has used to suffocate rivals, deprive them of oxygen, and really leave a stunted landscape in its wake.”The states involved in the case are Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Nevada, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin.Next steps in the caseThe complaint was filed in the US District Court for the Western District of Washington, and seeks a court order blocking Amazon from engaging in the allegedly anticompetitive behavior.The FTC isn’t ruling out a possible breakup of Amazon — nor the potential for individual executives to be named in a landmark antitrust case against the e-commerce giant, according to Khan. Speaking Tuesday just hours after the lawsuit was filed, Khan declined to say that the FTC would specifically seek a breakup as a remedy to Amazon’s allegedly illegal monopoly. “At this stage, the complaint is really focused on the issue of liability,” Khan said at the event hosted by Bloomberg News in Washington.But the agency’s complaint, filed in Seattle federal court, suggests that any court order to address the issue could include “structural relief,” a legal term referring to a potential breakup of Amazon. Asked about that request, Khan said the FTC is broadly interested in any relief that can effectively stop Amazon’s allegedly anticompetitive behavior.“Ultimately, you will want to make sure that any remedy is halting the illegal conduct, preventing a recurrence and ensuring that Amazon is not able to profit and benefit from its illegal behavior,” Khan said Tuesday afternoon. “When we get to the issue of remedy, those are going to be the principles we’ll be focused on.”Khan also left open the possibility that Amazon executives could be held personally liable if there is sufficient evidence of their responsibility for Amazon’s allegedly illegal conduct. “We want to make sure that we are bringing cases against the right defendants,” Khan said in response to a question from CNN about whether the FTC considered naming specific executives in Tuesday’s case. “If we think that there is a basis for doing so, we won’t hesitate to do that.”The suit makes Amazon the third tech giant after Google and Meta to be hit with sweeping US government allegations that the company spent years violating federal antitrust laws, reflecting policymakers’ growing worldwide hostility toward Big Tech that intensified after 2016. The litigation could take years to play out. But just as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and his spectacular wealth have inspired critics to draw comparisons to America’s Gilded Age, so may the FTC lawsuit come to symbolize a modern repeat of the antitrust crackdown of the early 20th century.In a release, Khan accused Amazon of using “punitive and coercive tactics” to preserve an illegal monopoly.“Amazon is now exploiting its monopoly power to enrich itself while raising prices and degrading service for the tens of millions of American families who shop on its platform and the hundreds of thousands of businesses that rely on Amazon to reach them,” Khan said. “Today’s lawsuit seeks to hold Amazon to account for these monopolistic practices and restore the lost promise of free and fair competition.”Amazon rejects Khan’s logic“Today’s suit makes clear the FTC’s focus has radically departed from its mission of protecting consumers and competition,”said David Zapolsky, Amazon’s senior vice president of global public policy and general counsel. He said Amazon’s practices have helped spur competition, innovation and selection across the retail industry. He argued that Amazon has fostered lower prices, faster delivery and helped small businesses sell their goods. “If the FTC gets its way, the result would be fewer products to choose from, higher prices, slower deliveries for consumers, and reduced options for small businesses — the opposite of what antitrust law is designed to do,” he said. “The lawsuit filed by the FTC today is wrong on the facts and the law, and we look forward to making that case in court.”In a subsequentblog post , Zapolsky warned that the FTC suit could not only force Amazon to list products at a higher price point than on rival marketplaces, but also that it could raise Amazon’s costs of doing business — costs that may then be passed along to consumers in the form of higher Amazon Prime subscription prices or slower shipping times. “We respect the role the FTC has historically played in protecting consumers and promoting competition,” the blog post said. “Unfortunately, it appears the current FTC is radically departing from that approach, filing a misguided lawsuit against Amazon that would, if successful, force Amazon to engage in practices that actually harm consumers and the many businesses that sell in our store—such as having to feature higher prices, offer slower or less reliable Prime shipping, and make Prime more expensive and less convenient.”Detail of the Amazon Prime streaming app on the screen of a Samsung Galaxy Tab, taken on October 6, 2021. (Photo by Olly Curtis/Future Publishing) Olly Curtis/Future Publishing/Getty ImagesAmazon is bringing ads to Prime Video and will charge you to avoid them For years, Amazon’s critics including US lawmakers, European regulators, third-party sellers, consumer advocacy groups and more have accused the company of everything from mistreating its workers to forcing itsthird-party sellersto accept anticompetitive terms. Amazon has unfairly used sellers’ own commercial data against them, opponents have said, so it can figure out what products Amazon should sell itself. And the fact that Amazon competes with sellers on the very same marketplace it controls represents a conflict of interest that should be considered illegal, many of Amazon’s critics have said.But Tuesday’s FTC suit is more narrowly focused, taking aim at Amazon’s behavior in two specific markets: an “online superstore” market, in which its conduct allegedly harmed shoppers; and an “online marketplace services” market serving independent sellers. Amazon’s deliberate self-preferencing of its own products in search results is an outgrowth of the underlying anticompetitive behavior at issue in the case, said John Newman, deputy director of the FTC’s competition bureau.A defining moment for Lina KhanThe lawsuit represents a watershed moment in Khan’s career. She is widely credited with kickstarting antitrust scrutiny of Amazon in the United States with a seminal law paper in 2017. She later helped lead a congressional investigation into the tech industry’s alleged competition abuses,detailing in a 450-page reporthow Amazon — as well as Apple, Google and Meta — enjoy “monopoly power” and that there is “significant evidence” to show that the companies’ anticompetitive conduct has hindered innovation, reduced consumer choice and weakened democracy. The investigation led to a raft of legislative proposals aimed at reining in the companies, but the most significant ones have stalled under a barrage of industry lobbying and decisions by congressional leaders not to bring the bills up for a final vote.Lawmakers’ inaction has left it to antitrust enforcers to police the tech industry’s alleged harms to competition. In 2021, President Joe Biden stunned many in Washington when he tapped Khan not only to serve on the FTC but to lead the agency, sending a signal that he supported tough antitrust oversight.Since then Khan has taken an aggressive enforcement posture, particularly toward the tech industry. Under her watch, the FTC has sued to block numerous tech acquisitions, most notably Microsoft’s $69 billion deal to acquire video game publisher Activision Blizzard. It has moved to restrict how companies may collect and use consumers’ personal information, and warned them of the risks of generative artificial intelligence.Mounting monopoly scrutinyThroughout, the FTC has scrutinized Amazon —suing the companyin June for allegedly tricking millions of consumers into signing up for Amazon Prime and reachingmultimillion-dollar settlementsin May with the company over alleged privacy violations linked to Amazon’s smart home devices. But the latest suit against Amazon may rank as the most significant of all, because it drives at the heart of Amazon’s e-commerce business and focuses on some of the most persistent criticisms of the company. In one heavily redacted portion of the FTC lawsuit, agency attorneys cryptically described Project Nessie, an “algorithm” and “pricing system” that has allegedly “extracted” an undisclosed amount of value “from American households.” It is unclear what Project Nessie is or how it works, but the FTC alleges in the complaint that the company’s program “belies its public claim that it ‘seek[s] to be Earth’s most customer-centric company.’” Amazon didn’t immediately respond to CNN’s questions about Project Nessie.In a sign of how threatening Amazon perceived Khan’s ascent to be, the company in 2021 called for her recusal from all cases involving the tech giant.Khan has resisted those calls. And in remarks to reporters this week, Khan deflected questions about her past work on Amazon, praising the efforts of FTC staff in completing the agency’s investigation. On Tuesday, the FTC said it held a unanimous 3-0 vote authorizing the lawsuit; Khan was among those voting to proceed.",US government and 17 states sue Amazon in landmark monopoly case,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/09/26/tech/ftc-sues-amazon-antitrust-monopoly-case/index.html
Catherine Thorbecke,"CNN — X, the social media company formerly known as Twitter, has scrapped a feature that lets users self-report political misinformation on the platform, a research group says, marking the latest safety-focused guardrail that X has rolled backsince billionaire Elon Musk took the helm.The move was first spotted by an Australia-based digital policy think tank, Reset Australia. The group of researcherssent an open letter to Xwarning of the potential harms this can cause as it came just weeks ahead of a major referendum vote on whetherto change the Australian constitutionto establish an Indigenous advisory group with a direct line to government. “There now appears to be no channel to report electoral misinformation when discovered on your platform,” the letter from Reset Australia states. “It is extremely concerning that Australians would lose the ability to report serious misinformation weeks away from a major referendum.”The rollback also comes as political campaigning for the United States 2024 presidential election ramps up, and concerns about the spread of misinformation online remains a keystone issue ahead of the US vote. X did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment Wednesday morning. X users, notably, can still report content on the platform for violations in other categories — such as “Hate,” “Abuse & Harassment,” and “Violent Speech,” among other issues. Musk has also long touted the platforms “Community Notes” feature, which lets users add context they think is missing to posts. The user-reporting featureinitially launched as a testfor a small group of users in the US, South Korea and Australia, X (then called Twitter) announced in August 2021. The feature allowed users to report a post as “it’s misleading” when they encountered problematic political content. In January 2022, the company said it was expanding the misinformation reporting feature to more countries and users. Musk’srocky takeover of Twitter , meanwhile, was officially completed in October 2022.

Musk has long opined concerns about perceived censorship on the platform and its need to focus onpromoting what he views as “free speech.”In other recent changes to its approach to political content,X announced last monththat it will again allow political ads on the platform — for the first time since 2019 — and said that it is hiring for its safety and election teams ahead of the 2024 US presidential vote.","X has ditched a political misinformation reporting feature, researchers say",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/09/27/tech/x-twitter-misinformation-reporting-feature-scrapped/index.html

Nell Lewis,"CNN — The petrol-blue wings of a swallowtail butterfly, soft fur of a giant Patagonian bumblebee, and oil-painted smudges of a ladybug are some of the details captured by British photographer Levon Biss in a new book that documents insect decline. Released on 22 November, “Extinct & Endangered: Insects in Peril” is a collaboration between Biss and the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH). It features photographs of 40 insect species that are either vulnerable, threatened or already extinct. Biss spent two years photographing the insects, capturing every extraordinary detail from strands of hair to the reflection in a wing. Each individual image was created from over 10,000 photographs taken using a bespoke rig and microscope lenses. They were then layered together, producing a single shot that’s fully focused and contains minute details normally invisible to the human eye.Using a special macro photography technique, Biss is able to capture the texture and exquisite beauty of the endangered Luzon peacock swallowtail. Levon Biss/American Museum of Natural HistoryHe hopes that the clarity of the photographs will allow the viewer to see insects in a new light, inspiring respect for the tiny creatures that are too often seen as an irritation – waved off with the shrug of an arm or squashed with the back of a book. “Hopefully people can look at one of my images and just marvel about how beautiful this thing is, look at the engineering that nature has created within these insects – they’re beautifully functional,” he said. Insects in crisis One man's mission to photograph 20,000 species Insects, whether beetles, bees or butterflies, are essential to the planet’s survival. Some are pollinators, helping in the production of fruits and vegetables, others are decomposers, recycling plants and animal matter into the soil, and many form the base of food chains that underpin natural ecosystems.But globally, more than 40% of insect species are in decline and a third are endangered, with their rate of extinction eight times faster than mammals, birds and reptiles, according to a2019 scientific reviewpublished in the journal Biological Conservation.""Extinct & Endangered: Insects in Peril"" is out now in hardcover. AbramsThe majority are threatened by human actions, the report says, such as intensive farming practices and urbanization, which have led to severe habitat loss, and pollution from pesticides and fertilizers. Biological factors such as pathogens and introduced species, and climate change are also key drivers. Biss hopes that the “Extinct & Endangered” book will raise awareness of the crisis of insect decline, and the effect it will have on humans. “Even though insects are small, they’re the most populous animal or creature out there – and if we lose them, there’s a significant impact to the way we live,” he said.“Unsung heroes”All the insects photographed in the book come from the archives of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, which contain more than 34 million artifacts and specimens in total. Nearly 20 million of them are arthropods – insects, arachnids and crustaceans from around the world.Award-winning landscape photographs show fragility of the natural world Those photographed for the book were selected based on the specimen’s condition, its geographic range, conservation status, and the scope of threats. “We really wanted stories attached to each one of the specimens,” said Biss. “So that when somebody’s reading the text of the image, they can understand, why is this thing gone? Why is it disappearing?”Biss says the book is written for all ages and he insisted that the global common name be used before the Latin name, in a departure from museum publication tradition.The insect specimens were couriered to the UK, where Levon Biss photographed them in his studio. Elli Biss“I want the text for these images to be able to be understood by an eight-year-old boy or girl, and also an 80-year-old man or woman,” he said. “It has to be able to engage all walks of life, otherwise you’re limiting the number of people that you can affect.”The release of the book, published by Abrams, coincides with an ongoing exhibition at the AMNH that opened in June, where the the 40 images are magnified in enormous prints, some stretching eight feet wide. Stunning images from African Wildlife Foundation's photography award are inspiring conservationLauri Halderman, AMNH’s vice president of the exhibition, said that she is excited for the book to share its message with a global audience. “Insects are the unsung heroes in so many ecosystems, and our project calls attention to both their importance and the threats posed by their decline,” she said. Biss specializes inmacro photographythat gets up close and personal with the subject. He has photographedseeds and fruitsin extraordinary detail, insect eggs, the human eye and even mold growing on tea bags. But he believes that “Extinct & Endangered” is one of the most meaningful projects of his career. “If you hold on a pin an insect that is never going to fly on this planet again, primarily due to human influence, it’s a humbling experience,” he said. “I want people to appreciate these creatures more, understand the work they do for us and the value that they have.”",Extraordinary close-up images show insects as youve never seen them before,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/extinct-endangered-insects-levon-biss-c2e-scn-spc-intl/index.html
Sadie Andrew,"CNN — If you’re one of many people who have swallowed a whole piece of chewing gum by accident, one question likely popped in your head right after that startling sensation.How long will the gum stay there? There is a common notion that it will sit in your stomach for seven years after being swallowed.Not true.“It’s an old wives’ tale,” said Simon Travis, professor of clinical gastroenterology at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom. “I’ve no idea where the myth came from — I can only imagine that it was suggested because someone wanted to stop their children from chewing gum.”Swallowing gum is only harmful to the body if done in excess, Travis said via email, which is very rare. He explained that swallowing three or more pieces of gum per day would be considered excessive.“If you swallow chewing gum, it’ll go through the stomach, and go through into the intestine, and pass out unchanged at the other end,” Travis said. “There are cases of chewing gum lodging in the intestines of infants and even children if they’ve swallowed a lot, and then it causes an obstruction. But in over 30 years of specialist gastro practice, I’ve never seen a case.”woman with stomach ache, menstrual period cramp, abdominal pain, food poisoning Boonchai Wedmakawand/Moment RF/Getty ImagesWhat passing gas can say about your health Dr. Aaron Carroll, adistinguished professor of pediatrics and chief health officerat Indiana University,has written several books debunking myths about the body.Carroll agreed that swallowing gum won’t do you any harm, but he wouldn’t actively encourage it.“It has no nutritional value,” he said. “Gum is made out of gum-based sweeteners, flavoring and scents. Gum base is a mixture of elastomers, resins, fats, emulsifiers and waxes. So I wouldn’t say it’s healthy.”How long have people chewed gum?Before gum became commercialized and sold in the packets we see today, it was used by ancient peoples to stave off thirst and hunger, according to Jennifer Mathews, professor of anthropology at Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas, and author of “ Chicle: The Chewing Gum of the Americas, From the Ancient Maya to William Wrigley .”Mayans chewed on a substance called chicle, which comes from the sapodilla tree prevalent in southern Mexico and Central America, Mathews said.“Chicle is a natural latex that comes from something called the Chico sapote tree, or sapodilla tree,” Mathews explained. “If you cut into a chico sapote tree, the latex starts to ooze out as a form of protection. It forms a barrier to protect the tree. Well, you can just pull it off the tree, and start chewing on it.”Similarly, the Pima Indians in what is now the United States chewed on spruce tree sap for thousands of years before European settlers picked up on the habit and it became commercialized, Mathews said.When to worry about swallowing gumUnless you are in pain or have swallowed a lot of gum, Travis and Carroll said you don’t need to go to the doctor if you accidentally swallow a piece whole.“It’s a theoretical problem,” Carroll said. “You theoretically could get something big enough in a small child to cause a blockage, but this is not something that regular people need to worry about.”However, for people with problems with their gastrointestinal tract, or GI tract, which is a series of organs joined together in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to theanus, swallowed gum could cause issues.“If things are open, and there’s no blockages, there’s no narrowings, things are going to go through just fine,” said academic gastroenterologist Dr. Leila Kia, an associate professor of medicine at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.PeopleImages/iStockphoto/Getty ImagesWhat happens if you exercise but don’t eat well? “If there’s a narrowing or you have really severe inflammation for whatever reason, or you have a motility problem, where your stomach or your colon isn’t emptying in the way that it should, then certainly eating something like gum or something that can’t break down, it can hang around and that can actually cause problems,” Kia said. Crohn’s diseaseis a common cause of inflammation in the GI tract and can cause it to narrow, according to Kia. She said doctors would usually recommend a low-residue diet for Crohn’s patients, which avoids certain foods like raw fruit and vegetables, nuts and seeds, popcorn, and gum.Some types of cancer and surgeries can cause that narrowing. “Certainly, if you were to swallow many pieces of gum, that could become a problem if you have only a tiny stomach or your anatomy’s been rearranged, which is essentially what happens when you have gastric surgery,” Kia said.Still, Kia has never removed gum from anyone’s body, although she has removed dentures that she thinks were swallowed inadvertently.

Tom Foster,"CNN — Californian EV-maker Lucid has opened the first ever car manufacturing plant in Saudi Arabia, as the kingdom looks to establish itself as a global player in the EV race.Lucid officially opened the plant in King Abdullah Economic City, near Jeddah, on Wednesday. The factory — the company’s first international plant — will initially focus on re-assembling vehicle kits sent over from the United States.“With the support of the Saudi government, we are proud to drive local development in the technology industry,” Lucid CEO Peter Rawlinson said in astatement . “We look forward to delivering Saudi-assembled cars to customers in Saudi Arabia and beyond.” Saudi Arabia’s powerful Public Investment Fund (PIF), controlled by the Saudi government, is Lucid’slargest shareholder. The Saudi government also has an agreement with Lucid to purchase up to 100,000 vehicles from the company over a 10-year period.The new factory will initially deliver Lucid vehicles that have already been put together at the company’s first factory in the United States, then disassembled for shipping, then re-assembled at the plant in Saudi Arabia. While the factory initially has an annual production capacity of just 5,000 vehicles, the company says it intends to begin from-the-ground-up production at the Saudi factory “after the middle of the decade,” with an additional annual capacity of 150,000 vehicles.Saudi Arabia wants 30% of new car sales in the kingdom to be electric by 2030. The country has looked to electric vehicles as a way to boost its manufacturing sector as it faces an inevitable decline in demand for the oil it has relied upon, and has courted other western companies in the EV industry in the hope of diversifying its economy.In 2022, the PIF set up a state-backed EV brand, calledCeer , which last month announced a deal with Siemens on designing and building electric cars. Earlier this month, The Wall Street Journalreportedthat Saudi Arabia had also held talks with Tesla over an EV factory in the kingdom. Tesla CEO Elon Musk dismissed the reports, however,sayingthey were “utterly false.”For Lucid, the Saudi factory milestone comes during a turbulent period for the company, whose shares have struggled since its IPO in 2021. In March, the companylaid offaround 18% of its workforce as part of a cost-cutting plan. Lucid shares are down more than 60% over the past 12 months.

Amy Woodyatt,"CNN — The formation of a new “supercontinent” could wipe out humans and all other mammals still alive in 250 million years, researchers have predicted.Using the first-ever supercomputer climate models of the distant future, scientists from the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom predicted how climate extremes would intensify after the world’s continents merge to form one supercontinent, Pangea Ultima, in around 250 million years.They found it would be extremely hot, dry and virtually uninhabitable for humans and mammals, who are not evolved to cope with prolonged exposure to excessive heat.Researchers simulated temperature, wind, rain and humidity trends for the supercontinent and used models of tectonic plate movement, ocean chemistry and biology to calculate carbon dioxide levels.They found that not only would the formation of Pangea Ultima lead to more regular volcanic eruptions, spewing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and warming the planet, but the sun would also become brighter, emitting more energy and warming the Earth further, experts noted in the paper, published Monday in the journalNature Geoscience.A chimney from the Linden Cogeneration Plant is seen in Linden New Jersey April 22, 2022.Kena Betancur/VIEWpress/Getty Images'Not nearly enough.' IEA says fossil fuel demand will peak soon but urges faster action “The newly-emerged supercontinent would effectively create a triple whammy comprising the continentality effect, hotter sun and more CO2 in the atmosphere,” Alexander Farnsworth, senior research associate at the University of Bristol and lead author of the paper, said in a release Monday.“Widespread temperatures of between 40 to 50 degrees Celsius (104 to 122 degrees Fahrenheit) and even greater daily extremes, compounded by high levels of humidity would ultimately seal our fate. Humans – along with many other species – would expire due to their inability to shed this heat through sweat, cooling their bodies,” Farnsworth added.The increased heat, Farnsworth noted, would create an environment without food or water sources for mammals.This image shows the geography of today's Earth and the projected geography of Earth in 250 million years, when all the continents converge into one supercontinentUniversity of BristolWhile there are large uncertainties when making predictions so far into the future, the scientists said that the picture appears “very bleak,” with only around 8% to 16% of land on the supercontinent habitable for mammals.Carbon dioxide could be double current levels, according to the report, although that calculation was made on the assumption that humans stop burning fossil fuels now, “otherwise we will see those numbers much, much sooner,” Benjamin Mills, a professor of Earth system evolution at the University of Leeds and a report co-author, said in the release.This grim outlook is no excuse for complacency when it comes to tacklingtoday’s climate crisis , the report authors warned.

Here's what that could mean for the US “It is vitally important not to lose sight of our current climate crisis, which is a result of human emissions of greenhouse gases,” co-author Eunice Lo, research fellow in climate change and health at the University of Bristol, said in the release.“While we are predicting an uninhabitable planet in 250 million years, today we are already experiencing extreme heat that is detrimental to human health. This is why it is crucial to reach net-zero emissions as soon as possible,” Lo added. Climate change is on course to transform life on Earth, with billions of people and other species due to reach points where they can no longer adapt unless global warming is dramatically slowed, according to a majorUN-backed report published last year.Scientists have warned for decades warming needs to stay below 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, with thewindow to cut our reliance on fossil fuelsand avoid catastrophic changes that would transform life as we know it rapidly closing.
